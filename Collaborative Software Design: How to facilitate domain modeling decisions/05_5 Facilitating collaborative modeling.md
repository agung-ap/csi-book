### This chapter covers

- Different stances a facilitator takes
- Fundamental skills for different stances
- Underlying skill set of the fundamental skills
- Applying facilitator skills in a collaborative modeling session
- Facilitating collaborative modeling sessions remotely

In the previous chapter, we discussed the six stages of the collaborative modeling process. By now, you’ve gained a solid understanding of what collaborative modeling entails, its flow, the various tools and styles that can be used in a session, and how to design software architecture using this approach.

This chapter will focus on the role of a facilitator and the different stances you can adopt during collaborative modeling. We’ll detail the skills necessary to become an effective facilitator, delving into how to apply collaborative styles in a facilitation role and outlining the responsibilities of a facilitator at each stage of the process. Even if you’re not aiming to become a facilitator or don’t feel confident in that role, some of the skills that aid a facilitator are also beneficial for participants in collaborative modeling. Honestly, all these skills can help everyone not only become better at their job but also in their personal growth and interaction with others.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

## 5.1 The role of a facilitator

The term *facilitator* is derived from the French word *faciliter*, which means “to render easy;” thus, a facilitator is someone who makes things easier for others. In the context of this book, a facilitator’s role is to make the flow of collaborative modeling easier for the participants. While facilitators guide collaborative modeling, they don’t bear the weight of the outcome. That responsibility rests with the collective group. It’s essential to understand that a successful facilitation doesn’t always guarantee the desired outcome. Sometimes, even if the process is flawlessly managed, the end result might differ from initial expectations. However, a different outcome doesn’t necessarily mean it’s unproductive or negative. As the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

The essence of being a facilitator isn’t confined to a specific job title. Whether you’re a team lead, software architect, user researcher, business analyst, software tester, software engineer, or any other roles in an organization, you can embody the role of a facilitator. The crux of the matter is that individuals across various roles all have the potential to guide and influence. We strongly believe that most collaborative modeling sessions should feature at least one, if not several, dedicated facilitators. This arrangement ensures that someone is exclusively focused on steering the flow and dynamics of the session, enabling participants to zero in on the session’s goals and results. Merging the roles of a facilitator and a participant can introduce distractions, potential conflicts of interest, and a diminished focus. Such overlaps can significantly undermine the productivity and success of the session. While it’s not impossible to combine these roles, and we occasionally do, the subsequent chapters will delve into the potential pitfalls and guide you on when the presence of a dedicated facilitator is indispensable.

Now let’s delve deeper into how a facilitator can adopt multiple stances during the process. They might act as an observer, coordinator, coach, enabler, counselor, or task organizer. Among these, the role of an observer stands out as the foundational stance for a facilitator that in every role is needed, as illustrated in figure 5.1. Depending on the situation, a facilitator can embrace all or some of these roles.

![Figure 5.1 The facilitator takes on different stances. The observer stance takes a central place, which provides a facilitator with important information to take on other stances.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F01_Baas.png)

### 5.1.1 The facilitator as an observer

One of the first things we did when joining BigScreen, was assess the current situation. We wanted to understand the conflict between two developers, Jack and Rose, with regard to the redesign. We scheduled separate interviews with both Jack and Rose, so they would be more comfortable talking to us about the redesign. The stances of a facilitator apply not only to the collaborative modeling session stage but also to all the stages. Interviews can be done as part of the prep. During those two interviews, we heard things such as, “They aren’t listening to me when I am explaining my point of view,” and “I get the impression they don’t WANT to understand my idea.” We could hear the frustration in their voices when they were explaining how they got there. Their body language also changed when we started discussing this. We observed that they were mostly pointing fingers to the other person during their respective interviews.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Being an observer often extends beyond mere visual observation; it involves actively listening and engaging with individuals to understand underlying problems. In our case, interviewing became a crucial observational tool. We were fortunate with Jack and Rose, who openly shared their perspectives. However, as we expanded our conversations within the company, challenges arose.

When we sought to understand the back office’s problems, we scheduled a meeting with Tiago, the COO overseeing that department. Initially, we encountered resistance. Comments like, “Sure, there are areas to improve in the back office, but the development team has provided decent workarounds,” and “I don’t believe addressing this should be a top priority,” were common.

With our extensive experience observing individuals and groups, discrepancies became evident. For instance, while a department head might verbally downplay a problem, their tense posture or avoidance of eye contact suggested otherwise. These conflicting signals between words and body language are what we call *double signals*.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Moreover, we had concrete evidence of the back office’s challenges: frequent system downtimes, delayed responses to customer queries, and a high rate of clerical errors. These weren’t mere inefficiencies but significant operational problems.

From Gerald Weinberg’s book *System Design Heuristics* (Leanpub, 2018, p. 41), “The incongruence insight” became our guiding heuristic. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing when words don’t align with actions or other nonverbal cues, prompting a deeper investigati[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)on.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When words and music don’t go together, they point to a missing element.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

The “incongruence insight” heuristic suggests that when an individual’s words aren’t aligned with their tone of voice and body language, there’s an underlying element that’s not being addressed. In our model, that element became a shadow. In many situations, this misalignment can indicate a lack of safety. When people don’t feel secure, they might hesitate to discuss conflicts or contentious problems. The fear of repercussions or judgment can lead them to avoid the topic, hoping it will dissipate on its own. For instance, if an employee says, “Everything’s fine,” but their voice quivers and they avoid eye contact, it’s a sign that everything might not be as “fine” as they claim. The underlying problem, in this case, could be their discomfort or fear of addressing a particular conflict.

Creating an environment where individuals feel safe to express their concerns and address conflicts is crucial. We’ll delve into the importance of fostering such a safe space later in this chapter. Additionally, strategies for effective conflict management will be discussed in detail in chapter 8. For now, our emphasis is on honing the skill of observation to detect these incongruences in individuals or groups.

Upon recognizing the discrepancy with COO Tiago’s words and body language, we initially refrained from jumping to conclusions. While we had previously discussed the “incongruence insight” heuristic and its potential link to a lack of safety, it was essential not to prematurely impose this interpretation on the situation. Instead, we allowed the individuals to express their reasons.

As humans, we naturally interpret and make sense of the behaviors we observe. Completely detaching from our interpretations is nearly impossible. The key, especially in a facilitation role, is to be acutely aware of our own biases and interpretations. It’s about holding our interpretations lightly, being open to them being challenged, and not letting them dictate our interactions. We’ll go more in depth about how to do this later in chapters 6 and 7.

When we assume we understand someone’s feelings or motivations based solely on our experiences or beliefs, we risk misjudging them. This not only can lead to misunderstandings but can also damage the trust and rapport we’re trying to build. Thus, while it’s natural to form interpretations, it’s crucial to approach situations with an open mind and allow individuals to share their perspectives without feeling predefined. We’ll discuss how to handle these judgements a bit more later on in the chapter.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Patterns

From the observations that you make, you’ll try to detect if patterns are present. What makes a behavior a pattern? This behavior is notable for its repetitive aspect. It isn’t just a one-time occurrence but happens regularly. Moreover, this behavior is influenced by cultural norms. Within a certain culture where such behavior is acceptable, or even encouraged, individuals adopt it as a standard way of handling problems. However, this behavior doesn’t manifest in different contexts when faced with similar problems.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

For example, one developer mentioned that in their previous company, this pattern of behavior wasn’t observed. They had never been involved in prolonged arguments with someone else before. Yet, when they started working at BigScreen, they began to unconsciously adopt the practice of blaming others. This illustrates how behavioral patterns are often passed down within an organization, from established employees to new ones, either deliberately or inadvertently.

As a facilitator, we try to detect these patterns. We can use guiding heuristics again to help us with finding patterns. An example of a heuristic that helps us detect patterns [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)follows:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When someone says “this is how we do it here,” you know you’ve found a pattern of their specific culture.

A pattern doesn’t necessarily imply negativity. Many individuals possess patterns that prove advantageous both for themselves and those around them. At BigScreen, Caelan, the team lead, consistently ensured that they engaged in a one-on-one conversation with every team member weekly. These discussions typically lasted 15 to 20 minutes, although they could extend if problems arose. Such a pattern is immensely beneficial for a team lead. It can foster open communication, ensures that team members feel valued and heard, and promptly addresses any concerns, thereby promoting a harmonious and productive work environment.

When facilitating collaborative modeling, we’re there to facilitate the process to the group’s desired outcome. That’s why we want to look at coherent patterns in a group—not only in the individual—because collaborative modeling is a group process. We start by observing the behavior of individuals, try to find this pattern in the group, and then try to discover whether or not this pattern is[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) fractal.

#### Fractal patterns

We didn’t just observe pointing fingers and blaming each other within the development team; we also observed similar accusations from and toward the development team. Departments were criticizing other departments: “They aren’t listening to what we need,” and “They are just not interested in understanding how we work.” We call this a fractal pattern because this type of behavior was observable throughout the company. It’s innate to the organizational culture, or the team culture. A pattern is fractal when it’s repetitive, not just in time, but also at every scale of an organization, similar to mathematical fractals (see figure 5.2). We named this pattern the Only Criticize the Other pattern, where everyone is pointing fingers at someone else as the guilty party and not self-reflecting on their own beha[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)vior. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

![Figure 5.2 A fractal triangle pattern. This triangle is repetitive at every scale. The big triangle comprises three smaller triangles. Those smaller triangles comprise three even smaller triangles. You’ll find fractal patterns also in companies. Patterns exhibited by higher management will be observable on lower levels of the company.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F02_Baas.png)

##### Exercise 5.1

During your next company or department meeting, take a moment to jot down the patterns you observe. It’s challenging, but try to avoid interpreting these observations through the lens of your own biases. For instance, if you notice that one of your colleagues, say Julia, frequently interrupts others while they’re speaking, resist the urge to infer reasons, such as “Julia interrupts because she fears her opinion won’t be heard.” You can’t be certain of Julia’s motivations without directly asking her. Instead, record your observations factually: “Julia interrupts others #times during the session,” “Julia doesn’t interrupt *X*,” or “Julia interjects when the topic is *X*.” [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

What you then write down is your own thoughts and feelings about the observation, for instance, “I have the feeling she does this because she fears her opinion won’t be heard.” If possible, delve deeper to discern if these patterns are fractal in nature: Does anyone else exhibit this behavior? Is this “interruption” pattern pervasive across different levels within the company? Remember, it’s impossible not to interpret, but being aware of your own biases is crucial for objective[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) observation.

### 5.1.2 Other stances of a facilitator

As a facilitator, you’re always an observer. After a while, it becomes innate. You’ll observe a group and the interactions within that group and try to find patterns. The patterns that you detect will be used when taking a different stance during the collaborative mod[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)eling process.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Coordinator

The responsibility of a coordinator in an organization is to ensure others work together effectively when organizing events or activities. In the context of collaborative modeling, this means that you help to plan and design the collaborative modeling sessions. You’re the person responsible for preparing the content and space. When you’re internal, you have a lot more knowledge to work with, and you’ll have a better understanding of what the pain points are and how to prioritize those. When you’re an external facilitator, you’ll depend upon the input of the teams you’re working with. As we mentioned in chapter 4, we prepped the collaborative modeling sessions for BigScreen together with the development team. When we were doing this, we were taking the coor[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)dinator stance.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Coach

Just like an Agile coach, who plays a crucial role in supporting, empowering, and facilitating teams to adopt Agile practices and methodologies, your role as a collaborative modeling coach is equally pivotal in helping companies embrace collaborative modeling. As a collaborative modeling coach, you’re primarily tasked with guiding, challenging, and encouraging individuals to effectively engage with collaborative modeling, which includes honing their skills in using the necessary tools. A vital initial step in assuming the coach stance involves establishing clear expectations through “contracting” with the individual or group you’re coaching. This agreement should clearly define the boundaries of your support, empowerment, and facilitation, while also explicitly stating what should not be expected from the coaching relationship. Contracting can range from simple agreements such as consent for feedback during sessions to more complex arrangements, such as setting precise goals and outcomes for integrating collaborative modeling within a company.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

At BigScreen, for example, we dedicated our first session to tool demonstration. We illustrated how Big Picture EventStorming functions, actively modeling the interactions among stakeholders, including adding swimlanes and pivotal events. Gradually, we shifted the responsibility to the participants. Instead of doing it ourselves, we encouraged them to take the lead: “That’s an interesting point. Would you want to add a pivotal event for that? Remember to phrase it [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)in the past tense.”

##### Note

As you might already know, coaching is a well-established field. For those seeking deeper insights, we recommend starting with *Coaching Agile Teams: A Companion for ScrumMasters, Agile Coaches, and Project Managers in Transition* by Lyssa Adkins (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2010).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Enabler

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)An enabler is a person who enables others to achieve a certain end. That end can be the goal of the collaborative modeling session, making inclusive decisions, and so on. As a facilitator, it’s your responsibility to remove roadblocks for individuals or the group that prevents them from achieving that ending. We remove those roadblocks by using the skill set of the facilitator, which we’ll discuss in section 5.3. For example, when doing Big Picture EventStorming, some people in the group might stay more in the back, while others will start talking through each other. In that case, we can give back to the group what is observed so that they become aware of their unconscious behavior, giving them an opportunity to improve their flow. We call that a climate report, which we’ll discuss [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)further in chapter 8.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Counselor

Sometimes as a facilitator, you have to be a counselor, by supporting individuals in the group. The individual interviews we scheduled with Rose and Jack when we first arrived at BigScreen were done by looking at this problem from a counselor stance. As a counselor, you’ll listen to the problems that people are experiencing. You’ll help to guide them to better understand their emotions and their triggers during group dialogues. This is a big responsibility. We understand that there is a limit to what you can do as a counselor. It’s important that you know yours. To help someone, sometimes the best decision you can make as a facilitator is to refer this person to someone who is bet[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ter equipped than you. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Task organizer

As we mentioned before, you’re not responsible for the outcome of a collaborative modeling session. You’re a task organizer, you’re responsible for making sure that all tasks are picked up by an individual or a subgroup. You create a contract between you and these people and follow up to make sure that they respect this contract. The easiest way to do this is to track the to-dos on the whiteboard and take a few minutes each session to go over them and update their progress. When you’re updating their progress, we also use the enabler stance to remove possible roadblocks. We ask questions such as these: “Is there anything preventing you from moving forward with this?” or “What do you need to complete this to-do?”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

All of these different stances require certain competencies. In the next section, we’ll dive into three important core competencies that you need to develop as a facilitator to take on all [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)of these different stances.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

## 5.2 The core competencies of a facilitator

Learning to take on different roles as a facilitator definitely takes a lot of practice. In any organization, anyone can become a facilitator if they’re willing, no matter what their job is. This includes a wide range of people, from software engineers, testers, architects, and data scientists, to business analysts, UX researchers, managers, product managers, and C-level executives. It even includes roles you wouldn’t usually associate with facilitation, such as assistants, cleaners, and project managers. What matters most isn’t the job title, but the ability to create a collaborative environment, keep things moving smoothly, and transition groups through different parts of collaborative modeling.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Software architects, technical leads, agile coaches, and consultants are often seen leading collaborative modeling sessions. This is mostly because they have had many opportunities to build up these key skills. However, this doesn’t mean they are the only ones who can do it. With the right training and experience, anyone in an organization can step into this role and make a meaningful difference when given the chance. We’ll talk more about what “given the chance” means in the next chapter on ranking theory.

Competencies which are inspired by the Lewis Deep Democracy method meta-skills, are broad qualities that support a range of specific skills, or skill sets. These core competencies grow through using your skill set, and getting better at them also makes your skills more effective. For a collaborative modeling facilitator, there are three main competencies and skill sets that support each other, as shown in figure 5.3. These are Compassion, developed through holding space; Neutrality, built through holding space and active listening; and Observing, developed through active listen[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ing and clear communication.

It’s important to realize that the three main competencies of a facilitator—Neutrality, Observing, and Compassion—can be learned by anyone. We’ll keep highlighting how important these competencies are for everyone involved in collaborative modeling. While some people might find these skills come naturally, others might need more time to learn them. Remember, these skills might seem natural, but they aren’t something you’re born with. They are learned, often without realizing it, over time. Let’s first take a closer look at each of these three core competencies to und[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)erstand what they really mean.

![Figure 5.3 The link between facilitation skills and core competencies. Core competencies consist of Compassion, Neutrality, and Observing, and they are fundamental yet require self-awareness and adaptability across cultures. These competencies enhance the facilitation skills of Holding Space, Active Listening, and Clear Communication, which can be improved through study and practice.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F03_Baas.png)

### 5.2.1 Neutrality

This might sound confusing, but being fully neutral is unattainable. The goal of acting neutral is to ensure that everyone in the group feels they are treated equally different. *Equally different* is the idea that every culture or individual is unique, but they all have the same right to be recognized and respected for their differences. Neutrality doesn’t always guarantee that outcome. The aim is to create an environment where participants feel psychologically safe to express their ideas, ask questions, voice concerns, and make mistakes without fear of punishment or humiliation. Understand that psychological safety doesn’t mean a conversation is always comfortable. Some discussions that include tense conflict might be uncomfortable, but they should never border on unsafe. As facilitators, our responsibility is to support each participant in a manner that makes it safe for them to speak up, even in moments of discomfort or tension. Yet, it’s essential to understand that while we aim to be neutral, we might not always achieve it. Still, the effort is crucial.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Neutrality means we must strive to be selfless and support everyone in the group equally different, genuinely, and sincerely by considering all possibilities, perceptions, opinions, and emotions. It’s important to create an environment where people feel free to express views and concerns, even if we disagree with them or find them unproductive. The key is to ensure these opinions are heard and understood by the group, fostering a sense [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)of inclusivity and understanding.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

If you feel the urge to react to opinions being made, write these down, and reflect on them after the session.

We want to be able to identify all wisdom and potential in the group. We want to support as much as possible in collaborative modeling because it will make our models more useful. As a bonus, the models will be more supported by everyone. Supporting or understanding ideas or perspectives doesn’t mean we must accept them; it means we listen and understand what has been said and find a way to support that concern. For instance, we might be able to understand and listen to why someone new to the team likes to do a branching strategy for developing software. But we might not accept it in our development lifecycle of the team because we believe in fast feedback cycles.

Instead of immediately dismissing their opinion, we should understand why they like it. Listen to any perspectives and concerns the person has. It might be because the person had a lot of harsh comments on their code when exposing it to their previous team. The person might be afraid of the backlash and the resulting feeling that they aren’t good enough. Now joining another team, that fear is even greater because there is no trust yet. The way for them to feel safe is developing on a branch in solitude, making sure the code is perfect for exposure to people. So, knowing that, we might come to new ways or ideas that support that safety for the person and bring us fast feedback. We might pair up with the person, making sure they get time with everyone in the team so they can feel comfortable. We might let the person work on a branch, but ask them to create a merge request ever[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)y day so we can review it faster.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

##### When not to act neutral

In certain contexts, acting neutral may not be practical or expected, particularly when you have a specific role within a team, such as a developer, consultant, architect, or when dealing with conflict resolution.

As a developer involved in facilitating collaborative modeling for your team, your input as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) on software design is crucial. You shouldn’t hesitate to share your perspectives. When you do, establish what we call a “contract” with the group: seek their agreement for you to momentarily step out of your facilitator role to express your opinion as an SME. You might even use a physical marker, such as a circle drawn on the ground with painters tape, to delineate when you’re acting as the facilitator and when as the SME.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

In the role of a consultant, your clients mostly hire you for your expertise, advice, and experience. They anticipate and value your insights. It’s essential to be transparent about your objectives, facilitate the team in acknowledging and agreeing on the current problems, and ask the team explicitly if they need advice and guidance to solve that problem.

For architects tasked with critical domain-level decisions, especially those involving risk mitigation, maintaining neutrality can be challenging. In such situations, it’s effective to clearly communicate the risks to the group and underscore the urgency of reaching a decision during the meeting together.

Lastly, in situations of major conflict where there is a polarized divide between two groups, and you’re part of one, neutrality may not be the best approach. In such cases, having facilitators representing each side can ensure that both perspectives are[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) fairly considered and addressed.

#### Dealing with your own shadows

We as facilitators might be biased and have prejudices about ideas a group has, or we might have totally other ideas! Knowing our biases and prejudices is essential because if we’re unaware of them, it can affect the way we react. We don’t want to give the person the feeling we’re against the idea. We must stay open to ideas, or people will notice and won’t speak up.

Facilitators can learn a lot from the anthropology field. Anthropologists do qualitative research through participant observation to observe a culture as they are. They want to capture the culture as is, which means they need to let go of any preconceptions to let all events happen naturally. But it’s also well known in the field that it’s impossible to do so. So instead of focusing on making sure not to have any preconceptions, they instead spend time understanding these preconceptions and capturing them. When anthropologists write field stories about their participant observation, besides describing what happens in the group, they also describe what happens to them. Trying to suppress your own emotions and prejudices during facilitation is a losing battle. We call those emotions and prejudices the shadows within us. Ignoring and suppressing shadows will turn them into demons at some point. If we ignore and suppress these shadows long enough, they will eventually become too strong to suppress, and they will come out when it’s the most inconvenient in a burst of emotion, making us lose our neutrality beyond repair.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)Instead of suppressing, we must acknowledge the stark reality that we all harbor irrational beliefs and prejudices. While some of these may be influenced by our emotions, they can also stem from other sources. It’s essential to confront these inner demons and understand how to address them when they surface. Address them early on, when they are still shadows, making them easier to manage. During facilitation, it’s natural to occasionally drift from neutrality. However, by recognizing these moments, we can recalibrate and return to a balanced perspective. This is why we describe neutrality as a verb; we continuously monitor and address our biases, ensuring they don’t cloud our judgment. This vigilance is a lifelong practice, both in facilitation and in our daily lives.

Working on your inner thoughts and emotions isn’t new behavior to humanity. The ancient philosophy of stoicism already has practices to deal with shadows. A common misunderstanding is that stoics are people that don’t have emotions. However, stoics have a massive understanding of their emotions and have dealt with them and reflected on them daily. That’s why, in the moment, when something happens, they aren’t overcome with emotions, but already understand them and come to terms with them. Coming to terms with one’s emotions allows us to act seemingly emotionless in challenging situations. A common practice you can do before you a collaborative modeling session is to imagine all possible scenarios that might happen. Stoics call this *premeditatio malorum*, which helps us deal with the shadows and demons ahead. Rehearse what happens in your mind, especially feel what happens within yourself. What situations might trigger you, and what preconceptions might you have about the problem being modeled? How will that person who annoys you push you this time, and how can you genuinely listen and understand? Are there any conflicts in the group that might show up? And what does that do to you? How would you react if you didn’t p[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)repare for it? Let the demons out!

##### Exercise 5.2

A good exercise to help you find biases and preconceptions in yourself is to experience different cultures, especially the ones we consider to be extreme or weird. One of the coauthors loves watching documentaries on YouTube by Louis Theroux who visits these many different subcommunities of our society and gives you an inside experience. Locate and watch some of these documentaries and videos to see and experience what biases and prejudice you have. What judgements did you make about them? Would you be able to stay neutral given their opinions and the way they act? From these examples, learn how to ask powerful questions to uncover more about their culture w[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ithout losing too much neutrality.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.2.2 Observing

Working on neutrality gives us access to more information from communication channels. *Communication channels* refer to the various ways in which information, feelings, thoughts, and perceptions are conveyed within a group. The communication channel is a way to observe behavioral patterns that groups are dealing with that might hold them back or block the flow of collaboration. Behavioral patterns are happening in the group and in the shadows of the group, which they are unaware of but which we can help them see and deal with.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Observing extends beyond the realm of active listening. While active listening emphasizes tuning into a person’s verbal and nonverbal communication (which we’ll delve into later in this chapter), observing encompasses a broader spectrum that involves observing the interactions among group members, as well as identifying the dominant culture and subcultures within the group. *Group culture* refers to the shared values, beliefs, and norms that guide behavior within a group, while *subcultures* are smaller groups within the larger group, each with its distinct values and behaviors. How does one subgroup’s values and behavior contrast with another’s?[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Additionally, it’s crucial to note the positions individuals assume within the group and the dynamics of their movements toward or away from one another. Equally important is the surrounding environment, which often houses cultural artifacts. These artifacts, such as posters or symbols, offer insights into the group’s culture[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/), revealing underlying beliefs and values.

##### An example of cultural artifacts in the surroundings

One of the authors had an experience with a company focused on organizing their teams around business processes. In this company, numerous business capabilities were recognized as shared responsibilities among different teams. However, there was a lack of ownership for these capabilities, especially when problems occurred. These problems were reported in a ticket system and bounced from team to team, all assigning the ticket to the other team to solve it.

An interesting observation was made in the area leading from the building’s staircase to the workspaces. There were doors with notes attached, requesting they be closed to avoid drafts. Yet, each time the coauthor visited this client, these doors were invariably left open. Curious, they asked the managing director who was responsible for closing the doors, and the response was that it was everyone’s responsibility.

This scenario is a clear example of how behavioral patterns within IT settings can be reflected in the physical aspects of a workplace. The consistent problem with the open doors was a direct mirror of the organizational behavior, where shared responsibilities were acknowledged but not actively managed by any specific team, demonstrating what is known in organizational studies as *fractal patterns*.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Lastly, and perhaps most subtly, is the need to be observing the group’s shadows. This refers to the underlying, often unspoken or unrecognized, aspects of group dynamics that aren’t immediately observable. By being conscious of these shadows, we can gain a deeper understanding of the group’s inner workings and potential challenges.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Becoming fully conscious: using the flashlight

The way to observe the group’s shadows is what we call metaphorically “using a flashlight.” With the flashlight we can shed light on the unconscious part—the shadows of the group where deeper emotions live. Following are examples of the unconscious shadows:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

-  Losing a teammate
-  Fearing speaking up because of a previous manager who always started shouting when they disagreed
-  Feeling insecure when new to the group
-  Making quick decisions and judgments due to cognitive bias

To observe these individual and group behavioral patterns, we must be aware of our unconsciousness. It’s more than what we discussed in neutrality. It’s also about our deeper emotions. How are we feeling today? Are we calm, or is something keeping us busy?

You can think of it like a rugby player that sprained their ankle, so they will find it much harder to run. The same goes with emotions, if we’re upset or stressed, it will be harder to observe the shadows in the group because our consciousness is clouded. For instance, let’s take not feeling welcome as an example of an emotional trigger. A lot of things can trigger that emotion. Perhaps someone isn’t reacting the way we expect or is questioning every step we take. We might get emotionally distressed because of it and that can lower our neutrality. As a result, we might act on our shadows and start working hard to eliminate that feeling by forcing that person to react the way we want them to react by dictating the session and using our rank to do so. Or we might defend every step we take that is being questioned by the group. But working hard on our inner thoughts and emotions with self-reflection helped separate and eased that emotion so we could factually observe what was going on. Perhaps that person isn’t feeling well today or is feeling insecure. So, we should see which is true: Are they not welcoming, or are our shadows getting in the way? And judging whether it’s about ourselves or something in the group gets harder the more emotionally distressed we feel. Because, yes, we might not be welcome in a group.

So, it’s crucial to stay in contact with and deal with your feelings and stress level before and during a session. There are a lot of ways to do so. Some people might do mindfulness exercises, others might do coaching sessions, or and still others may choose to go to a therapist. Sometimes quick remedies might work, such as taking some medicine to calm us down. But we would always advise looking deeper into your mental state and feel where your distress is coming from. We’ve mentioned using a notebook before to write down heuristics. We do the same with self-reflection before and after eac[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)h session to write down our emotional patterns.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

If you find yourself feeling drained or exhausted by the facilitation process, it might be an indicator that you’re taking on too much responsibility or don’t have enough skills yet to facilitate that specific session. Facilitation should not be overly taxing.

In the end, we’re complex beings, and you need to do what will work for you because what works for one person may not work for the other. Experiment and become self-aware of how you feel and deal with situations. Discover what works for you. One important signal to watch out for when you know you’re fighting your shadows is if you’ve worked too hard in the sessions. If you’re exhausted, what [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)is there to learn and do differently next time?[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.2.3 Compassion

If we truly understand our own shadows, we become equipped with a deeper insight into the complexities of human emotions and struggles. This understanding doesn’t necessarily mean we’ve experienced the exact same challenges as others, but it gives us a foundation to approach their struggles with compassion. To understand those shadows, we require the skill of compassion during collaborative modeling. We can only give space to all different perceptions, how weird or wrong we might find them, with compassion. Compassion is feeling upset by another person’s negative emotions and trying to help them deal with it if that person wants your help. Compassion isn’t that you’re the problem solver, the one in power to solve the problem for the helpless. Compassion is about recognizing our shared humanity. Can I recognize my shadows in the other, and vice versa? We as humans give meaning to things. Nothing is inherently right or wrong on its own, but through interaction in groups, communities, and cultures, we assign meaning to things to decide what is right and what is wrong. Compassion is about whether I can find myself in you and empathize with you.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Compassion is also a type of empathy according to the psychological field, but not every form of empathy is compassion. There are many different types of empathy, and we find the ones described by Indi Young in her book *Time to Listen* (Indi Young Books, 2022) have the most use to us in describing what compassion is for a facilitator. As a facilitator, it’s essential to distinguish between what Indi describes as compassion, also known as empathic concern, and other types of empathy, particularly empathic distress and empathic listening (commonly called “empathy”). With *empathic distress*, we feel upset by another person’s emotional state but aren’t motivated to help that person. As you can guess, that isn’t so useful for our collaborative modeling session, and we see no use for this skill as a facilitator, but it can be handy in other situations.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

With *empathic listening*, we try to let the other person feel understood when experiencing certain emotions. It goes deeper than compassion as we try to connect and support that person but don’t try to relieve that person’s suffering. The challenge with empathic listening is that connecting and supporting every single person in the group is very hard to do in a collaborative modeling session. It will drain your energy. Does that mean that we shouldn’t have any empathy at all in collaborative modeling? No not at all! There are certain situations where the group and the outcome of the group are blocked because a person doesn’t feel understood, connected, and supported. In that situation, we use empathic listening as facilitators. We also try to enable the group to connect and be empathetic with each other, making it a collective thing of the group instead of people being dependent on us. We want to coach the group to connect wit[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)h each other, let the group empathize with each other![](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Liminality

We also need to prioritize compassion over empathy because a collaborative modeling session means groups are in a liminal state. A liminal state or *liminality* is the process of transitioning between two states. An example given to us from the anthropology field is that people transition from a child to a grown-up. That doesn’t happen overnight, and that gradual transition is what we call liminality. They aren’t children anymore, but they are neither grown-up, so what are they? Everyone has been in liminality, and you probably have experienced that it means there is a lot of uncertainty and chaos. An example might be when your teams changed from the waterfall to Agile way of working, or you went from being a software engineer to working DevOps. Liminality can cause a lot of emotional distress to people, so it’s vital to work on your compassion to help people if they need help with that liminality. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

During a collaborative modeling session, groups are also in liminality. Before the meeting, people all have their mental models of the problem, that is their own concepts that give their own meaning to the problem. During collaborative modeling, we give people the space to express these mental models, but at the same time, people will be exposed to other people’s mental models. Maybe our own beliefs are being challenged, so during collaborative modeling, our understanding of the problem isn’t valid anymore. Still, we also don’t know the new shared mental model that we can use, so it’s good to experience collaborative modeling sessions yourself. What do you experience in that liminality? Can you recognize yourself in the other person? Can you recognize why people behave the way they do? Being a participant yourself together with all the knowledge we share with you in this book w[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ill make you better at being compassionate toward others.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.2.4 Using and learning the core competencies

Unfortunately, our core competencies aren’t so quickly learned, and you might not be able to use them depending on the context and the group you’re facilitating for. They are culturally dependent and ranking dependent, as well as dependent on the people allowing you to use them. For example, it will be hard to work on your neutrality as a facilitator if you’re the company’s CEO. But if you, as the CEO, will facilitate a collaborative modeling session outside your own company, you can be more neutral. Another example might be that you’re facilitating a group from a different country, and the cultural differences cause people stay to remain quieter or behave differently, making it harder to observe what is going on. Or, perhaps you’re a woman in tech, facilitating a group of guys who don’t accept your leadership. In the next chapter, we’ll talk more about ranking and the effect it can have on the group and yourself. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Another aspect that might affect these core competencies is how people perceive you. How you’re perceived, particularly in terms of self-esteem and charisma, can influence the effectiveness of your facilitation. Do participants see you as confident and engaging? Can they relate to your enthusiasm, stature, and expertise? These perceptions are shaped by the values and beliefs of the group members. For instance, while some might view an individual such as Donald Trump as exuding self-esteem, others might interpret his behavior as stemming from deep-seated insecurities. If group members perceive you as lacking confidence, they might be hesitant to embrace your compassionate approach and engage with the collaborative process.

However, it’s worth noting that while perceived self-esteem and charisma can be advantageous, they aren’t the sole determinants of a successful facilitator. The essence of facilitation lies in understanding, compassion, and the ability to guide a group toward a common goal. Awareness of one’s standing within a group is crucial. Indeed, navigating the intricacies of group dynamics and perceptions can be among the most challenging aspects of facilitation. While learning from failures and being receptive to diverse perspectives is invaluable, it’s not the only path to self-awareness. Continuous reflection, seeking feedback, and immersing oneself in diverse environments can also foster a deeper understanding of oneself and others.

By being genuinely curious about others’ viewpoints and fostering an environment where diverse opinions are valued, a facilitator can guide a group toward more inclusive discussions. This not only shifts perceptions but also paves the way for more effective collaboration, ultimately leading to su[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)perior outcomes, such as the creation of exceptional software.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

## 5.3 Skill set of a facilitator

The relationship between a facilitator’s core competencies and their broader skill set is closely connected, as we’ve previously discussed. The trio of core competencies form the foundation for effectively using a wider range of facilitative skills. This relationship isn’t one-directional; the additional skills you develop also help to strengthen and enhance your core competencies. For instance, the interaction between Holding Space and Compassion, shown in figure 5.4, demonstrates this point: while holding space is based on compassion, truly embracing compassi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)on involves a deep understanding of the art of holding space.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

![Figure 5.4 The relationship between a facilitator’s core competencies and their wider skill set. Each skill set is tailored to refine your facilitation within that area. View these skill sets as a solid starting point for actionable techniques that you can use in your next collaborative modeling session.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F04_Baas.png)

In this section, we’ll examine each of the following skill sets in more detail: clear communication, active listening, and holding space. We’ll look at how these skills are not only important on their own but also how they support and reinforce the core competencies. For each skill set, we’ll present specific techniques that you can apply immediately in your facilitation work. Keep in mind that the skills we discuss here aren’t the only skills available. We’re providing a snapshot of what we believe to be the most important fundamental skills at this moment. There are many practical skills that you can develop in each skill set, which will continue to evolve over time. View these skill sets as a solid starting point for actionable techniques that you can use in your next collaborative modeling session. In addition, be prepared to explore and develo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)p your skills further in the ever-evolving field of facilitation.

### 5.3.1 Clear communication

During our childhood, there was a memorable activity. Participants were paired up; one person was blindfolded while the other provided verbal instructions to navigate a route filled with obstacles. Some called it a “game of trust” due to the blindfold. However, for us, it was more aptly a “game of clear communication.” The challenge lay in articulating directions so explicitly that your blindfolded partner could follow them to a tee, even without the benefit of sight. For instance, you might say, “Take 5 steps forward.” As your friend took their steps—one, two, three—suddenly, BAM! They’d crash into an obstacle, realizing it was really only three steps, not five. This highlighted that clear communication is tough but integral, making the game both challenging and fun. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

As we age, the importance of such clear communication magnifies, though mastering it remains elusive. While some of us might recall encountering diagrams illustrating communication concepts—like the one displayed in figure 5.5—their terminologies often seemed detached, doing little to enhance our real-world communication skills. Clear communication means articulating your thoughts and directions in such a manner that leaves little room for misinterpretation or error. It’s about being exact and direct, ensuring the[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) receiver understands the intent behind each word or instruction.

![Figure 5.5 The communication lifecycle. A (not so helpful) diagram often used when teaching students about communication.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F05_Baas.png)

Communication is a dynamic, nonlinear process that involves the exchange of information, ideas, emotions, or intentions between individuals—not a linear process as depicted in figure 5.5. As a facilitator and a participant, you’ll be communicating a lot, guiding the process of collaborative modeling or sharing your input. So, what can you do as a facilitator to communicate clearly? First, you need to develop your observing competence, which we discussed in the previous section. Second, clear communication flows out of good planning, shared language archi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)tecture, and summarizing. We’ll dive a bit deeper into each one now.

#### Planning

Being well-prepared directly enhances how clearly you can communicate. Knowing the goal and objectives helps you understand what the group aims to achieve. When these goals are clear in your mind, you can express your thoughts with more clarity and confidence, answer questions effectively, and give important insights. In addition, when the purpose of the session is clear, you can communicate with more focus, keeping discussions on track.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

That’s why preparing for collaborative modeling sessions is so crucial. As a facilitator, you create a plan for the session. This preparation is all about organizing to ensure clear communication. You set a goal for the session that everyone gets, so they know that’s the main point. You consider who should be there. You set up the meeting in advance and send out the agenda, so participants know what’s coming and can get ready. Being prepared means you can also think ahead about possible questions or problems and be ready to respond clearly and effectively. This way of planning improves understanding and cuts down on confusion. Plus, it means you can adapt if things go in an unexpected direction during the session.

It’s just as important for participants to come prepared, so letting them know what to expect is key for a successful session. We need to emphasize that some groups also need to do their homework before a session. These groups can handle a lot of information but need time to process it. We want to get all the useful information from everyone, and if these groups aren’t ready for the session, the[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)y might not speak up, and we’ll miss out on their knowledge and wisdom.

#### Shared language architecture

*Designing a shared language* is a technique that helps people discover, understand, and develop their own language, symbols, and metaphors. Instead of forcing people to use the language that a facilitator is comfortable with, they will be helping the group and individuals understand their own language throughout the collaborative modeling. As a concrete example, for EventStorming, we’re familiar with the word *policy* as a sticky note that indicates we need to react to a domain event, as mentioned in chapter 2. However, in an insurance company, the word *policy* is already a well-defined term, so using that as a concept might confuse people. We can architect a different word when doing EventStorming in that context. The same can happen for a business word, if we look at the following conversation from BigScreen:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

You: When you sell a ticket, do you always pay for a seat? When the business organizes a themed day, do they pay for a seat, or do they pay for entry?

B: They pay for entry. We have multiple theater rooms that show movies; people don’t select which one they will join beforehand.

You: Okay, we haven’t really modeled purchasing tickets for a themed day yet, let’s do that now and see what is similar and what is different from purchasing a ticket for a movie.

After modeling the themed day purchase, the group realizes that not every ticket has a seat, so it would be confusing to keep saying that people pay for seats. They settled on calling the domain event Ticket Sold. A seat became optional, depending on what you’re purchasing a ticket for. So shared language architecture in this context applies to two things: making sure everybody in the room understands each other (and themselves), and designing the ubiquitous language.

First, to make sure that everybody understands each other and themselves, you’ll function as a translator. During collaborative modeling, people from different disciplines with different backgrounds will be joining the sessions. Each person has their own communication style and language that they use. At some points during a session, people are loudly agreeing with each other or silently disagreeing. As a facilitator, it’s your responsibility to try and detect when this is happening and create clarity on this. You can create clarity by Socratic questioning, a technique we’ll discuss a bit later in this section.

Second, you’ll help to design a ubiquitous language, a pattern from Domain-Driven Design, which we discussed in chapter 2. The intent behind designing a ubiquitous language is to improve the clarity of communication. The domain language is something that grows organically over time. There are words that are overloaded or different words to point to the same concepts. Some examples of overloaded words are “customer,” “client,” and “product.” These words mean very different things to different people. In software development, a product is the software system. In other contexts, a product is something physical. Customer and client often refer to the same concept. In figure 5.6, we show some examples specific for BigScreen. You’ll help the group clean up these misconceptions, for example; “Seats paid” or “Ticket sold” could be referring to the same domain event. It’s your job to dig a bit deeper into the language here, find out their meaning, and clean it up as needed.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

![Figure 5.6 Domain language isn’t always clean. When there are multiple words referring to the same concept, misconceptions arise because of the language. Make these terms explicit during a collaborative modeling session.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F06_Baas.png)

#### Summarizing

Summarizing during collaborative modeling sessions is more than just a tool for recapping information; it’s a navigational aid that steers the collective understanding and guides the trajectory of discussions. Before diving into the specifics, it’s essential to recognize that summarization isn’t merely a passive reiteration of events or dialogues. Instead, it’s an active process that distills the essence of exchanges and insights, refocusing the group’s attention and setting the stage for what’s to come.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Throughout the session, your role transcends mere facilitation; you become the group’s compass, providing real-time summaries that encapsulate decisions, reflect opinions, and, importantly, confirm or redirect the group’s understanding. This continual synthesis serves a dual purpose: it ensures no one veers off the shared path due to confusion or misinterpretation, and it verifies your grasp of the information, which is crucial for maintaining the session’s coherence and momentum.

Closing summaries, provided at the session’s conclusion, aren’t simply about action points or conclusions. They’re strategic overviews that guide the group toward deciding what comes next. What problems warrant a deeper dive? What deserves immediate action? These summaries act as both a mirror, reflecting the session’s accomplishments, and a window, projecting the next steps. Incorporating summarization as a fundamental component of your sessions acknowledges its power not just as a reflective tool, but as a proactive strategy for enhancing clarity, improving overall communication,[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) and, crucially, providing a clear, shared direction for your diverse group.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.3.2 Active listening

Active listening is a concept that finds its origin in clinical psychology. It emphasizes the importance of explicitly verifying whether you truly understood the message, verbally and nonverbally. One of the ways to do that was already discussed when talking about clear communication: cleaning language and summarizing. When you’re cleaning the language, you’re explicitly verifying the meaning of words and concepts, trying to understand what is being said.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

In addition, active listening requires asking a lot of questions. We’ll dig a bit deeper into Socratic questions and clean langua[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ge here, but there are a lot of different categorizations to be found when googling.

#### Socratic questioning

Throughout the previous chapters, we mentioned that the stakeholders need to have a deep, shared understanding of the business problems. We understand that it’s easier said than done. Luckily, as a facilitator, yo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)u can help develop that deep and shared understanding by using Socratic questioning which we learned from Tony Bruce. *Socratic questioning* aims at creating a thoughtful dialogue to validate a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)nd improve the understanding of one’s own thoughts, ideas, opinions, and beliefs.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

![Figure 5.7 The six categories of Socratic questioning with generic example questions that you can adapt during a collaborative modeling session](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F07_Baas.png)

In section 5.1, we briefly touched on the conflict between Rose and Jack from BigScreen. In the next paragraphs, we’ll dig a bit deeper into the six categories (figure 5.7) of Socratic questioning by analyzing the interviews that we did with the two developers.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

-  *Clarifying thoughts and belief**s*—During the interviews, both developers mentioned that they believed the other person didn’t want to understand their point of view. It’s important to clarify what their opinion actually is. We dug a bit deeper by asking questions such as the following: “Why do you think your solution for the redesign is a good one?” You’re trying to find the origin of their thinking to clarify it for you, and these questions often clarify things for them too.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)
-  *Challenging assumption**s*—People make unconscious assumptions. As a facilitator, it’s our responsibility to find and question those assumptions. The two developers, Jack and Rose, made a lot of assumptions about the other person’s intentions and saw this as “the truth.” One of those assumptions was that the other person didn’t want to understand them. We challenged that assumption: “Are you sure that Jack/Rose doesn’t want to understand you?” Who is to say that the other person wasn’t trying to understand their opinion? Conflicts often arise from built up assumptions over time. These assumptions aren’t conscious. Neither Jack or Rose thought at some point “from now on, I am going to believe they don’t *want* to understand me.” This assumption of not wanting to understand became part of their view and then influenced their interpretation of the other person’s actions and words.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) By challenging this, we wanted to bring Jack and Rose back from their belief “my point of view is the truth,” to an understanding of “this is how I experienced it.” Once both parties understood that this was their experience, there was room for an open dialogue again between the two. To shift their point of view on the conflict, we also challenged the content of the conflict (my solution is the best solution): “Under which conditions would your solution not be the best one to move forward with?” In a conflict, people start getting overly attached to their solutions, and we want them to see and accept other perceptions as well. We believe nobody holds the monopoly on the truth. We’ll talk a bit more on how you can let people see other perceptions as well by staying in the holding space. In chapter 8, we’ll explore conflict resolution deeper as well.
-  *Providing evidenc**e*—Once you clarify someone’s thinking and beliefs, and challenge their assumptions, you ask for evidence to support these. We reminded them that there was a time they got along when challenging their assumptions about the conflict. Then, we asked for examples to solidify those new discoveries: “Can you give an example of a disagreement between you and Rose where she was trying to understand you?”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)
-  *Discovering alternative viewpoint**s*—In this scenario, we already have alternative viewpoints that resulted in conflict, but it never hurts to look for more. The team was much larger than just Jack and Rose. Perhaps because of the conflict, other people’s ideas were forgotten or not mentioned. We might ask, “Did everyone agree to pick your solution?” and “Was there someone who had another solution?”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)
-  *Exploring consequence**s*—There are people who overvalue the benefits of their ideas and the downsides of other people’s ideas. You don’t want people to shoot an idea down, you want them to explore the consequences of this option and compare it to the other possible solutions. This can be done by asking questions such as the following: “How easy would it be to continue redesigning with Jack’s approach?” and “If we picked your design, what would be difficult as a result of that?”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)
-  *Questioning question**s*—Questioning questions makes people better at asking questions themselves: “Why do you think I asked for an example of Rose listening to you?” and “Why was it important that we asked you about why Jack sees it another way?” This type of question helps people reflect on what happened and helps them learn from it. In the future, when Rose and Jack disagree again, they will remember our questions, as well[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) as our questions about the questions, and ask them themselves. At least, we hope they do.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Clean language

Socratic questioning can be an effective tool for delving deeper into a domain or technical topic and examining its tradeoffs. However, it’s important to consider the context and subject matter before using this method. In the case of Jack and Rose during the interviews, it was a helpful technique. However, when topics are emotionally charged or sensitive, it can come across as a critique of the speaker’s experiences, causing them to feel unheard and unsafe.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

In that case, we use *clean language*, which is a therapeutic technique to facilitate communication and exploration of thoughts and feelings. It involves asking questions that are simple, open-ended, and free of interpretation, allowing the speaker to articulate their thoughts and experiences in a clear and concise manner. The objective of clean language is to create a safe and nonjudgmental space for the speaker to access their internal resources, leading to increased self-awareness, personal growth, and problem-solving ability. The core principles of clean language include the following:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

-  Asking questions without including the questioner’s assumptions or suggestions, thereby allowing individuals to explore their own ideas and experiences without external influence or bias
-  Using the respondent’s exact words or phrases to formulate questions, which shows respect for their model of the world and helps keep the conversation centered on their thoughts and feelings
-  Avoiding metaphors or expressions that carry specific cultural or emotional baggage, which could influence or steer the conversation in a particular direction
-  Encouraging self-exploration a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)nd self-discovery, rather than suggesting or leading toward any particular insight or conclusion

##### Avoiding metaphors or expressions

The reason for avoiding metaphors and expressions during active listening is rooted in their cultural specificity. Metaphors and expressions are often unique to a particular culture, which means their use can unintentionally exclude or confuse the person you’re communicating with. Due to their cultural ties, they can be ambiguous and lead to misunderstandings.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

To illustrate this, consider a humorous example involving the authors of this text, all of whom are Dutch speakers although they hail from two different countries: Belgium and the Netherlands. These countries share the Dutch expression *met een sisser aflopen*. In the Netherlands, this phrase implies something along the lines of “It could have been much worse.” Contrastingly, in Belgium, it means something akin to “It ended quite disappointingly.” Despite using the same language, this expression conveys opposite meanings in these two cultures. So, if you were to use this expression with the authors, depending on their cultural background, you would likely receive very different reactions.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

In practice, clean language involves using a set of standard questions that are designed to be as free from assumption and direction as possible. These questions are often simple and are used iteratively, encouraging individuals to explore their thoughts and feelings more deeply.

For examples let’s revisit the challenging assumption example from before. When Jack makes assumptions about Rose, we can ask the following clean language questions:

-  What kind of understanding do you feel is missing from Rose?
-  Is there a specific moment or instance that made you feel Rose doesn’t want to understand you?
-  (later as a follow-up) When you believe “they don’t want to understand me,” how does that affect your response or behavior toward Jack/Rose?

Through this method, the speaker is given space and autonomy to delve into their own psyche, construct meaning, and arrive at their own conclusions, promoting a deeper, more personal understanding of their expe[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)riences and thought processes. (For more insights, see the reading recommendation in section 5.8.)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.3.3 Holding space

The third skill that a facilitator needs is holding space for people. *Holding space* means that the individuals in the group have the opportunity to voice their ideas, opinions, concerns, and so on about a topic in a way that makes them feel safe. This is why holding space is sometimes referred to as offering psychological safety for every individual in the group. People should feel comfortable expressing their ideas, opinions, problems, and emotions the way they want to. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

For example, some people like to have a dialogue where it’s okay to interrupt and talk through each other, while others like to fully tell their story before the other can start talking. Both are equally effective ways, and it depends on the person how they want to communicate. Another example is that some people just tell what is on their mind, while others need to grasp the full story before they will speak up. Some people are very passionate in sharing their emotions, while others will just use a few words. Regardless of how they communicate, they should not be scared of being punished or humiliated for asking questions, expressing concerns, or even for making mistakes.

When it comes to expressing their problems and emotions, they should be able to express those without getting unsolicited advice from you, the facilitator, or the group. It’s very common to jump into solution mode and start offering people advice on how to deal with a problem they’re facing and the emotions that come with that. Often, the person isn’t even finished with explaining the problem when we already put on our solution hats. So, holding space also means holding off advice and intercepting when people in the group start offering it. Clean language and Socratic questioning as discussed previously are powerful techniques that you can employ here. Holding space during a collaborative modeling session can be done by clean language, which we just discussed, letting people listen to each other and acknowledging feelings.

#### Letting people listen to each other

Are you a good listener? In general, nobody wants to answer no to this question. People want to be perceived as good listeners. Yet, people have this habit to listen so they can respond, not to understand. What does it mean when we say people listen to respond, not to understand? While someone is listening to an idea or opinion of another person, they are already formulating their counterarguments or their opinion on the topic. They are listening, but they aren’t actively listening. People feel like they have to convince the other person that their idea or opinion is better during a discussion. They often get trapped in “Your opinion is wrong, and my opinion is right.” Even as a facilitator, you can get caught in this right versus wrong trap.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Facilitators are actively listening to people during a collaborative modeling session. They are asking questions to understand, withholding their own opinion on the topic until they have reached a deep understanding. A good trick to hold space during a collaborative modeling session and to make sure people are actively listening to each other is to model the different ideas, which we also did at BigScreen, as shown in figure 5.8. We made people listen to other people by making sure everyone’s opinions and ideas were presented and well understood by the entire group. This technique also shifts the focus from the person to the model. We challenge assumptions about the model; we don’t challenge the person.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

![Figure 5.8 When people have a different vision or idea on something, model both ideas. Give the model a name so you can easily refer to it. Ask the group if anyone has the same opinion. If somebody has another opinion, model that one too.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F08_Baas.png)

#### Acknowledging feelings

As mentioned before, you can’t ignore the emotional aspect of being a human during a collaborative modeling session. We’re dealing with people, and people have emotions. To help people deal with their emotions, it’s important to acknowledge them, including the positive feelings. In a previous company, we were asked to create a new design for the UI. After presenting it, we were disappointed when it became clear that the manager didn’t like it. The manager dismissed the feeling of disappointment and responded by saying: “It’s not because you put a lot of effort into it, that I have to like it.” We felt hurt by their reaction to our disappointment, as it seemed unnecessary. When discussing this with the manager, they dismissed it again by saying we were “just easily offended.” It wasn’t the manager’s intention to hurt our feelings when he didn’t like the new design, but their actions had. Dismissing our feelings not once, but twice, had only made the situation worse, not better. “It’s my impression you felt disappointed that I didn’t like your proposal” would have been a much better start.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

While we described a lot of skills in this chapter you may alrea[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)dy have—or may be valuable to acquire—on how to explore and especially acknowledge people, human beings are neurodiverse and complex. Not everyone will react the same way on how you facilitate and how you employ these skills, and it can quickly become an unpleasant dynamic. In th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)e upcoming chapters, we’ll follow up more on when that happens and what you as facilitator can do about it.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

## 5.4 Facilitating sensemaking and collaborative styles

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)As explained in chapter 4, section 4.3, sensemaking is a very effective way to open up conversations about things that live in a group’s shadow, such as conflicts, negative emotions, and disturbed relationships. So why would you need a facilitator to guide you in these exercises? Why not just do it yourself? To answer that question, let’s take one step back. As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, the word facilitation comes from *faciliter* and means “to render easy.” Facilitation can therefore be interpreted as the “act of making something easier.” An important addition here is that it’s about making *the flow* easier, not the experience. A facilitator should have no skin in the game. They have no interest in the content of the sensemaking exercise or its outcomes, but rather are focused on the process of getting to that outcome and guiding the conversation toward it. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

As we saw in some of the examples in chapter 4, section 4.3, sensemaking is usually about delicate matters that can lead to uncomfortable, even painful situations. A facilitator can guide the group through these conversations, while creating a safe space for everyone to speak their minds. As explained in chapter 1, we see facilitators as catalysts. By using and choosing relevant heuristics, practices, principles, styles, and tools, the facilitator enables a group to reach its full potential. Mixing all the chemicals to create a safe space and use the full potential and wisdom of a group is a challenging role that requires the skills and capabilities we described in section 5.2 and 5.3.

In this section, we go into the need for a facilitator during sensemaking and collaborative styles. We dive into what the role of facilitators is during sensemaking exercises, including check-ins and check-outs;[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) how you can prepare yourself optimally for these sensemaking exercises; and how we can switch styles effectively.

### 5.4.1 Why do you need a facilitator?

One of the misconceptions we sometimes run into is that facilitating is mainly about coordination and being a taskmaster. Facilitating isn’t just about logistics and practicalities. The required skills we mentioned earlier in this chapter demonstrate that facilitation goes beyond that. Especially with delicate topics that usually get addressed during sensemaking, it’s about creating a safe space and including the entire wisdom of the group. Turning on the flashlight to make the shadows visible for everyone is hard and difficult, especially when emotions get into the mix, which is often the case when doing sensemaking exercises. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Sensemaking is almost never about lightweight, neutral topics that aren’t too important to people. They are usually around sensitive topics that live in the shadows and that we don’t let out that often. It’s where conflicts, disagreements, negative emotions, and polarities live. Remember the BigScreen example about physical proximity during a session from chapter 4, section 4.3.2? We never had to deal with this situation before, and some people felt judged because of their preferences. Another example is the EventStorming session BigScreen did where it came down to the question of whether they were building a standard product or customized solutions. It can feel really unsafe to speak your mind on topics like these. Your perspective might differ from the majority, or from management, in which case, it requires some vulnerability and strength to share your perspective. A facilitator can create that safe space where all perspectives can be on the table. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, facilitation requires skills on different levels. Observation, listening, asking questions, holding space, and so on are skills that need to be trained and require focus.

Facilitating sensemaking exercises when you’re part of the group is very hard because you most likely have an interest. It matters to you what the outcomes look like and how the conversation afterward flows. You can’t objectively facilitate those conversations. It wouldn’t be allowed and/or appreciated by the group either, probably because it can smell like persuasion. Next to all these rational arguments, it would be very uncomfortable to facilitate such sensitive exercises on topics that go into emotions of the group. Even if you do manage to stay neutral during the facilitation of those conversations, you might be left feeling frustrated because you couldn’t express your opinion.

That’s why you need a facilitator that can act neutral, make sure everyone gets the chance to speak their minds, create a safe space, ask the right questions, and guide the conversation. A facilitator can make sure it won’t turn into a conflict where no one listens to one another anymore, and instead create that safe space where people actually listen to each other. In the next secti[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ons, we’ll dive into the role of a facilitator during sensemaking: What does it take to get up that mountain safely?[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.4.2 The role of a facilitator during sensemaking

To get to the essence of certain conflicts, everything needs to be on the table. The sensemaking exercise is a stepping stone to the conversation that is needed. Seeing all perspectives reflected in dots or people’s physical position in a line during a sensemaking exercise creates awareness about the topic. Next up is creating mutual understanding and guiding fruitful conversations with more listening than talking. During that conversation, the facilitator listens, asks objective questions, and gives observations and summaries back to the group.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Doing that requires experience. There are lots of strong and weak signals flying around that a facilitator needs to look out for. Strong and weak signals are both pieces of information, activities, behaviors, or events that indicate changes that might affect a session, outcome, or result. Strong signals are obvious and easy to observe; weak signals are harder to detect. These signals tell you something about the dynamics, perspectives, and relations in a group. They can help you understand the shadows better.

Weak signals are harder to detect than strong signals. Weak signals might seem random and disconnected from the matter at hand, but can become important patterns when connecting it with other observations, signals and information.

Let’s relate it to the BigScreen example of standard product versus customized solutions. A strong signal would be if someone very clearly stated they are building a standard product and have always done so, and that this whole conversation is nonsense. A pretty strong signal of dissatisfaction and frustration. A weak signal in this situation would be if someone makes a seemingly harmless joke about joining the Friday afternoon drinks of another team this week. This might seem harmless and random, but could indicate that this person is disagreeing and not happy with the outcome, which makes them think about leaving the team. For a facilitator, these weak signals are especially important. Remember that one occurrence doesn’t make a pattern, so it’s about observing patterns by picking up on the strong and weak signals while guiding the group through a conversation. Nobody said it would be easy.

Another aspect of creating a safe space is making sure no one is put on the spot. It’s a common observation in many sessions—and sensemaking exercises—and you’ll probably recognize it: there’s a conversation (or discussion) going on about a certain topic and one (or a few) people stay very quiet. After a while, it starts to frustrate others because they might feel they are the only ones fighting for a perspective that they know is shared by the quieter people in the room. At that point, someone might put someone on the spot by directly addressing them and asking them to speak up because they’ve been quiet for a while. It might come across aggressive and result in a very uncomfortable situation. There’s probably a good reason for that person to remain quiet. Putting someone on the spot never results in what you were aiming for. It usually leads to politically correct answers, siding with the majority, or shallow reactions that don’t add any wisdom to the conversation. As a facilitator, this is where you intervene. Mitigating that spotlight and bringing the group back to a collective conversation. Even though you might feel that urge to put someone on the spot yourself while facilitating, we strongly advise you to never do that. It won’t add anything to the conversation and will only raise the bar for that person—and others—to speak their minds later on.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)This may feel like a lot to grasp, and, honestly, it is. To get you started, we’ve provided the steps we use when facilitating sensemaking exercises for inspiration. Every facilitator has their own style and techniques. Nevertheless, these steps might get you on your way:

-  Identify potential topics for sensemaking up front (polarities, conflicts, frustrations, tensions, etc.).
-  Prepare potential sensemaking exercise(s) based on what you discovered.
-  Observe patterns by picking up on strong and weak signals (write them down!).
-  When you feel it’s the right time, stop the session, and gather the group.
-  Show and explain the sensemaking exercise, and tell them what you expect from people (placing a dot on a sensemaking exercise, standing in a line, etc.).
-  Let the group do the sensemaking exercise.
-  Take a step back, and let everyone observe the output.
-  Ask the group if anyone wants to react to the output.
-  Ask the group if anyone wants to share something on why they placed their dot somewhere or why they are standing where they are.
-  Ask the group if something stands out by looking at the output.
-  Encourage people to listen before reacting.
-  When a minority perspective is being shared, ask who partly agrees with that by showing hands.
-  Guide the conversation, share your own neutral observations, and provide summaries.
-  Never put someone on the spot, and[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) intervene when others do that.
-  Ask what the group needs to continue.
-  Make agreements, and continue with the session. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.4.3 Facilitating check-ins and check-outs

As we’ve mentioned, check-ins and check-outs are a form of sensemaking with a specific purpose and timing. Having someone facilitating the check-in and check-out is important. That means preparing the check-in and check-out by sensing important topics for the group and creating questions around it, being an active listener, summarizing what has been said so everyone feels heard, capturing essential signals that you can elaborate on during sessions, and capturing and incorporating feedback you get from check-ins and check-outs to optimize collaborative modeling sessions. As you can see, there’s more to facilitating check-ins and check-outs than what you might guess at first.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

Another important aspect of the role of the facilitator is showing vulnerability. By being vulnerable, you can lead by example and hopefully lower the bar for others to also be (more) vulnerable. This is also why a facilitator takes the first turn in the check-in/check-out. You can set an example by answering the questions with some vulnerability. When you share something more personal with the group, others might also feel more comfortable and safer to share something personal, thereby building strong personal connections. From a practical perspective, this means you start your check-in and then stay quiet and wait for someone else to start sharing (following the popcorn style). Someone will always follow. It might take a while and feel uncomfortable at first to stay quiet, but it will be fine. Then, your job is to listen very actively and carefully. Making connections in your head (or on a piece of paper) between what people are sharing and clustering them. When you summarize what has been shared, make sure everyone feels heard by mentioning all the bigger clusters and some specific examples that stood out. Afterward, you ask if you missed something and if there’s anyone who wants to react to something. After that, you wrap up the check-in and move to the next agenda item.

A facilitator can also get a lot of information from a check-in and check-out that they can use to make a session better. You get a sense of the important topics and themes that exist within a group, and how the group feels about them. Do you observe a lot of sarcastic jokes when talking about a certain topic, for example? Then it’s very likely that there is some resistance to that topic. When it’s being mentioned multiple times that the follow-up of this session is extremely important and that it shouldn’t be just talking (as usual), it’s a clear signal for the facilitator. There might be some shadows lingering and waiting to be made explicit and talked about. Picking up on these signals—strong or weak—can help you as a facilitator guide the group toward better outcomes.

Similar to the steps we described regarding sensemaking in the previous section, we also use certain steps when it comes to check-ins and check-outs. Again, this is meant as inspiration, and we highly encourage you to gain experience and develop your own style and steps[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/):

-  Identify potential topics for the check-in or check-out up front (polarities, conflicts, frustrations, tensions, etc.).
-  Decide on the questions for your check-in and check-out: Is there a balance between personal questions to get to know each other better and questions on the session itself (e.g., goals)?
-  Decide if you want to send out some sort of pre-check-in where participants can already think about one or more questions, such as “What do you want to achieve in the upcoming session?”
-  If you sent out a pre-check-in, discuss it somewhere during the actual check-in.
-  Think about if and how you want to gather feedback during the check-out (e.g., the Wow/How about? method from chapter 4, section 4.4.4).
-  Prepare the check-in and check-out either on paper or a digital whiteboard.
-  When the session starts, explain what a check-in is and introduce the questions (use the characteristics we described in chapter 4, section 4.4.2).
-  As a facilitator, you go first in answering the questions, so you can show vulnerability and set an example in what others can share and how long they can take.
-  Give everyone the opportunity to share something.
-  Intervene when people interrupt or start a conversation during someone’s check-in (it’s a monologue!).
-  Summarize what you’ve heard during the check-in.
-  Ask if [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)you missed anything.
-  Ask if someone wants to react to something that was said.
-  Close the check-in or check-out and continue.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.4.4 Preparing to facilitate sensemaking

Being fully prepared for anything that could happen before, during, or right after a sensemaking exercise is an illusion. You never know what might pop up during a session that could benefit from sensemaking and require you to come up with a relevant exercise on the spot. It could also be that one exercise has a ripple effect and flashlights even more shadows or parts of them, meaning follow-up exercises are needed, or you need to guide a conversation that follows from an exercise. There are some things, however, that you can do to prepare yourself when it comes to sensemaking. Having some preparation work as backup—that you can adjust as you go—can help you with smooth facilitation of a session. We also keep previous sensemaking exercises and their outcomes. In follow-up sessions, it might be valuable to reflect on them or make them part of a conversation. Apart from the steps we described in the previous section, we want to dive into a few things separately, to help you prepare your next session. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

As a facilitator, you want to turn on the flashlights in the room so shadows become visible. Having an idea of what possibly lives in these shadows up front prevents surprises and helps you open conversations. We always try to get a feeling of what might be going on in the shadows of a group:

-  Are there any conflicts or disagreements present in the group?
-  Is there an ongoing debate about certain parts of a process, way of working, or decisions?
-  Are there any potential polarities that we need to consider?
-  Is there any tension between certain people?
-  Looking at the invited participants, do we expect powerplay or hierarchy?
-  Are there any potential hidden or second agendas in the group?

You won’t get an answer to all of these questions, but by having a conversation with someone from the group up front, you’ll have a hunch. When talking about the goal of the session, why they decided to have it at this moment in time, how excited people are, and if there is anything you should know up front, you’ll get a better feeling about potential shadows.

When we were preparing for an EventStorming session with BigScreen, we discussed the session initially with Ralph, the product owner. One of the topics we talked about was the timing of the session: it had to happen now, because the development team really needed to show some progress and results. The management was already questioning the new campaign and strategy, and feature delivery didn’t go as fast as they hoped it would. That’s why Meera, the CTO, pretty much invited herself to the session to see what it would bring. For us as facilitators, there’s a whole lot of information in this short talk: the development team is experiencing pressure and most likely frustrated, the product owner is under pressure to deliver and really wants to satisfy the management team, and the presence of Meera might cause fear or a feeling of unsafety for people. All of this lives in the shadows people brought to that EventStorming session. Based on the information we got, we could already prepare some sensemaking exercises to guide the session and conversation. Figure 5.9 shows an example of one of the exercises we used during that session. This triggered the conversation about feature delivery and expecta[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)tions. This was also an opportunity for Meera to ask questions about this outcome and for her role and effect to be challenged.

![Figure 5.9 One of the sensemaking exercises we did during an EventStorming session. We wanted to trigger a conversation on feature delivery and expectation so we asked the participants to place a dot where in general they spend most of their time on.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH05_F09_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)Preparing sensemaking exercises also means preparing to be uncomfortable. Usually, emotions are involved, and conversations can get heated. If you expect this to happen, think about possible outcomes and what you as a facilitator could do to guide the group in its conversation; similar to the premortem thinking we discussed in section 4.3.6. As you gain experience in facilitating sensemaking, this whole process will become more intuitive to you. We encourage you to use this as inspiration and start experimenting with sensemaking exercises in your own team or organization.

To add to this already delicate and complex matter, we also have to deal with a mix of in-person, remote, and hybrid sessions. Fa[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)cilitation of these different sessions requires different focus and things to look out for. In section 5.5, we’ll dive into this. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.4.5 Facilitating collaborative styles

Sensemaking is pivotal at every phase of a collaborative modeling session: beginning, during, and end. Preparation is key, as is understanding the versatility of collaborative modeling styles. Chapter 4, section 4.6, previously explored various collaborative styles, highlighting their significance in larger groups where achieving effective collaboration, deeper insights, and inclusivity becomes increasingly challenging. With our discussion on liminality, we’ve identified an additional application for these collaborative styles: assisting participants in navigating the inherent chaos and uncertainty. Liminality, defined by these very characteristics, offers a valuable opportunity for learning and growth, allowing us to leave behind outdated concepts and embrace new knowledge. Yet, it’s important to recognize that not everyone handles chaos and uncertainty in the same way. Here, collaborative styles serve as our compass, guiding individuals through the murky waters of liminality.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

In preparing for a collaborative modeling process, we consider which styles will best suit the session. For instance, during an Example Mapping session where team members are familiar with each other, anarchy might be the natural state in which the group flourishes, negating the need for additional styles. In contrast, preparation for a Big Picture EventStorming demands a more nuanced approach. We contemplate the specific styles applicable to each stage of the process:

-  Chaotic exploration -> Together, Alone
-  Enforcing the timeline -> Split and Merge
-  Walkthrough -> Ensemble

While these are mere guidelines, it’s essential to remember that each group is unique. The crux of successful implementation lies in using your core competencies, with a particular emphasis on group observation. For example, during a Split and Merge, we might agree with the group beforehand that splitting is necessary when membership exceeds a manageable size, perhaps seven or even five. Establishing this “contract” is crucial, ensuring the group’s agreement with the discussed terms. Should we then notice the group’s size ballooning without any splitting action, we can reflect their situation back to them: “I see your group has more than seven people.” A well-structured contract set at the beginning often encourages the group to take the necessary action themselves. It’s vital to remember that the group owns the outcome, and our role is to aid them in self-reflection and provide direction when they encounter obstacles. While this method was demonstrated for a Big Picture EventStorming, it’s adaptable and applicable when using other tools. The imperative is always to establish a contract and secure the group’s agreement prior to transitioning to a collaborative modeling style.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) We must avoid imposing collaboration methods on the group, as doing so would inadvertently rob them of their ownership of the outcome.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

### 5.4.6 What if you’re not the facilitator?

Earlier in this chapter, we emphasized the need for a facilitator’s neutrality and detachment from having stakes in the game. But what happens when you, as a participant, find yourself in a position where you’re not neutral and have a vested interest? So far, we’ve highlighted the importance of sensemaking, check-ins and check-outs, and adapting styles. But what if you’re in a session where these needs aren’t being met, either due to the absence of facilitation or because the appointed facilitator hasn’t recognized the need?[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

This is precisely why we advocate for everyone, not just aspiring facilitators, to read this book. By understanding the nuances of what makes some sessions less effective, you’re better equipped to intervene and help the session progress. The ultimate goal is for every s[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)oftware team to be conscious of these social dynamics, enabling them to more effectively navigate and enhance the flow of their sessions.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

In scenarios where you’re not the facilitator but have noticed a specific pattern within the group that could help in progressing the session, it’s recommended to share your observation based on your own needs. This approach allows you to contribute constructively without overstepping the facilitator’s role, offering insights that could be crucial for the group’s advancement.

When you decide to step in, it’s crucial to communicate from your personal perspective and observations. For example, if you notice the session began without a check-in and sense a general reluctance in the group, including your own, due to not knowing who’s present and their expectations, you might express this by saying, “Hey, I feel a bit hesitant to start because I don’t know who’s who and what everyone’s expectation is from today. Does anyone else feel similarly?” This method of sharing from your own perspective is key. As you’re not the facilitator, you don’t need to maintain neutrality; you can freely express your needs. This approach helps you contribute positively without overstepping the facilitator’s responsibilities. Rather than directly proposing a check-in, you raise the problem and probe whether others share your sentiments. If others resonate with your observation, it opens up the opportunity to suggest a check-in might be beneficial. At this point,[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) either the facilitator can step in to conduct the check-in, or you could offer to facilitate this part of the session before continuing.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

## 5.5 Dealing with remote facilitation

Everything we discussed and described in this book so far applies to facilitating collaborative modeling sessions in general. The same goes for the skills a facilitator needs as described in this chapter. They all help in guiding a group and making shadows visible. A trend we’ve been seeing over the past years is that more and more collaborative modeling sessions take place online. We find ourselves facilitating both in-person and remote sessions, and the scale is pretty balanced. Whether you facilitate remotely or in person, the required skills remain the same. However, there are also differences in the nature of an in-person versus remote session, that you as a facilitator have to account for. The most obvious one is the lack of physical presence in remote sessions. You’re not in the same room, and communication depends on cameras and microphones. As a fac[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ilitator, this means you potentially miss a lot of private and nonverbal communication that you would have observed in in-person sessions. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

##### Hybrid collaborative modeling: A unique challenge

You may have noticed the absence of hybrid methods in our discussion on collaborative modeling. This is no oversight—we advocate for sessions to be conducted entirely in person or online. The intricate nature and potential conflicts within these sessions make the hybrid approach particularly challenging. Disparities in technology access, obstacles in effective communication, and inconsistent participation levels can all introduce complications. Proper facilitation becomes exceedingly difficult, if not unfeasible, under these conditions.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

As mentioned earlier, should you find yourself in a hybrid scenario, we recommend a simple workaround: have all in-person participants use headphones and sit at their individual desks. This approach effectively converts the session into a fully remote one, leveling the communication playing field for everyone involved.

Long story short, there are benefits and potential downsides to both options. As a facilitator, it’s up to you to discover how you can make up for the lack of physical proximity and build connections in a digital manner. You’ll have to come up with structured whiteboard templates for the collaborative modeling tools you want to use, and think about how to get the most out of the exercise. Whether in a remote or in-person session, you’ll have to tailor your approach to the needs of the group. In this section, we’ll dive into the differences between remote and in-person facilitation, including benefits and downsides. Note that this entire section is from the perspective of the facilitator, not the group. With that in[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) mind, we’ll also discuss how to prepare remote sessions and how you can observe nonverbal communication and weak signals in remote sessions.

### 5.5.1 Benefits and potential downsides of the different forms

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)Collaborating via sticky notes and markers on brown paper in an in-person session is quite different from working together on a digital whiteboard such as Miro in a remote session. And then in a remote session, when you finally get a break and can step away from your laptop for a while, you find yourself talking to your cat instead of relaxing and chatting with colleagues over coffee or tea. As facilitators, you don’t get to observe what happens during the breaks in that context, which is usually very useful information that can tell you a lot about group dynamics and shadows. On the other hand, how wonderful is it to facilitate and participate in sessions in the comfort of your own home where your cat can lay down next to you, and you can enjoy some decent coffee or tea for a change? Not to mention that documenting outcomes after a remote session has never been easier for a facilitator because everything is already on the digital whit[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)eboard. Table 5.1 provides our experiences and examples of benefits and potential downsides of facilitating in-person versus remote sessions. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

##### Table 5.1 Benefits and potential downsides of facilitating in-person vs. remote sessions[(view table figure)](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/HighResolutionFigures/table_5-1.png)

|   | Benefits | Potential Downsides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In-person session | <br>      <br>       Natural social experience occurs that enables relationship building.  <br>       Spontaneous or organic conversations can take place during breaks.  <br>       Sessions receive focused attention and have fewer distractions.  <br>       Participants can be in a session and consume content for a whole day.  <br>       You can observe nonverbal communication (gazes, gestures, body language, positioning, group forming).  <br>       Creating a safe space is a bit easier to do.  <br>       Movement is an option, which keeps people more engaged and energized.  <br> | <br>      <br>       Documenting outcomes afterward is fairly time-consuming.  <br>       The presence of certain participants can be experienced as intimidating and lead people to stay more quiet.  <br>       It can be challenging to observe everything that’s going on in the entire space.  <br>       Some parts of the workshop are only available for people who were actually there.  <br> |
| Remote session | <br>      <br>       Documentation afterward is easy through digital whiteboards.  <br>       Digital whiteboards can be used to work collaboratively.  <br>       There are potentially fewer ranking challenges because everyone appears in the meeting the same way and on the same frame size.  <br>       People might feel more comfortable in their own space and therefore open up more easily.  <br>       Recording (parts of) the session makes it easier to share knowledge with people who weren’t in the session afterward.  <br> | <br>      <br>       More digital distractions are present.  <br>       We limit remote sessions to a maximum of 3 to 3.5 hours.  <br>       People might find it harder to stay focused and engaged, which is an extra challenge for a facilitator.  <br>       Observing nonverbal communication is more difficult.  <br>       It can be challenging to keep an eye on both participants on a small frame and the digital whiteboard at the same time.  <br>       Slowdowns occur due to technical problems or people who aren’t comfortable with the tools at hand.  <br>       Natural conversation flow can be challenging.  <br>       More preparation and coordination from facilitators is required.  <br> |

### 5.5.2 [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)Preparing a remote facilitation

When it comes to preparing for remote facilitation, there are a few things you need to take into account. In chapter 4, section 4.2.2, we already explained a bit about how we prepare a space for remote facilitation. Chapter 4, section 4.3.5, elaborates on sensemaking in remote settings. In this section, we’ll look into a few potential challenges that come with remote facilitation and share our perspective on how to deal with those. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Physical proximity

The most visible difference when it comes to remote sessions is the lack of physical presence, meaning you’re depending on technology to make up for what you’re missing as much as possible. We always discuss working agreements at the start of a collaborative modeling session, and this might be even more important in remote sessions. One of the working agreements we often use is “cameras are on as much as possible.” Of course, it can happen that someone needs to step out for a bit and turn off the camera, but the working agreement is cameras on. When someone has a good reason for keeping a camera off, it can be discussed at the start of the session, which can avoid misunderstanding and even frustration later on. As a facilitator, make sure you can see the group at all times. When working on a digital whiteboard, it usually works best to have both the whiteboard and people on a (separate) screen.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Observing nonverbal communication

Related to the lack of physical proximity is the diminished possibility to observe nonverbal communication. When you’re in the same room, it’s easier to observe body language, facial expressions, intonation, gaze, and group forming. Very often, weak signals (discussed in section 5.4.2) are communicated through nonverbal communication, which is why it’s so important for a facilitator to be able to observe this. Think about a closed or defensive posture, which we can observe by someone standing with their arms crossed or an evasive gaze when it comes to a specific topic. As facilitators, we try to observe patterns. In a remote setting, this is harder to do both because you only see a small part of someone via a camera and because you see everyone in the same frame in a similar manner at the same time. There are still things you can observe, but you need to pay attention to different things. For example, is someone leaning forward or sitting back with their arms crossed? Where are people looking—a screen where the session is happening or a different screen? Do people seem distracted? Are you seeing people looking at their phone or different distractions? Are people smiling, nodding, or making hand gestures? If people can choose a breakout room, do you observe anything about the groups that are formed? It’s different from being in the same room, but there’s still a lot to observe when it comes to nonverbal communicatio[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)n. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Up-front communication

We always send out some sort of communication to the participants before a collaborative modeling session. This is where we share the agenda, goal of the session, and some logistics. When it comes to remote sessions, we also share a link to a digital whiteboard that people can use to prepare themselves. In this introduction board, we add some guidance on how to use the tool so people can get familiar with it before the session, and we add some sensemaking exercises. Usually these revolve around the goal of the session: What do participants want to get out of the session, and what do they find most important? It’s a way to get used to the tool and our way of working, as well as a way to gather input before the session starts. We try to send this out a week before the session happ[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ens. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Technology

During remote sessions, you depend on technology. You need a communication tool such as Zoom to talk to each other, a digital whiteboard to collaborate on, and a VPN connection (for some organizations). You can’t mitigate this risk fully, but you can be clear about the different technologies that participants will need during the session and provide proper instructions up front. Prepare the digital whiteboard properly, provide instructions on an introduction board, and be available to answer questions. Provide the right links and passwords, and ask participants to check everything is working before the session. As a facilitator, it’s important that all participants can properly hear and see you. Make sure that the room you’re in isn’t too dark or light, that there’s no movement going on in the background and no background noises, and [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)so on. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Breakout groups

We use breakout groups very regularly during collaborative modeling sessions. Sometimes, it’s preferred to split up a group when doing exercises or when they are enforcing the timeline during an EventStorming session. It can be helpful to prepare these breakout groups up front. Open the meeting early and create the breakout rooms before the group gets in. That way, you only have to assign people to a room or let them choose when the exercise starts. Sometimes, it can be helpful to think about the groups before the session. If you know the participants already—because you’re in a follow-up session, for example—and you know what kind of exercises you’re going to do, you might want to get certain people together in a breakout group. Or, you might not. During EventStorming sessions, we also let people decide for themselves which breakout group they wanted to be in and let the group self-organize. All are possibilities, and as a facilitator, it helps to think all of them through ahead [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)of time. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

#### Breaks

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)Breaks are always important, and in remote sessions even more so. It’s harder to stay engaged and focused when you’re behind a screen and alone than when you’re in a room full of people walking around. Account for this in your planning. Take lots of breaks, and check in with the group regularly if they need a break or if they’re good to continue. We usually plan for a break each hour, but regularly check with the group about what they need. When we co-facilitate, we try to have one facilitator stay present in the call with the camera on. In remote sessions, you miss the spontaneous social chitchat that would happen over coffee in in-person sessions. By staying in the call as a facilitator, it provides people the opportunity to stick around and chat for a bit. Co-facilitators can obviously rotate t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)urns here. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)

## 5.6 Collaborative software design catalysts

-  In your upcoming collaborative modeling session and/or meeting, make a conscious effort to incorporate the following Socratic question: “Could you provide further insight by offering an example of *X*?” Feel free to rephrase the question in a way that feels more natural to you. Examples clarify a lot of confusion when discussing a topic. With practice, it will become second nature to ask for clarifying examples.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)
-  When someone in your next meeting expresses a heavy or negative emotion, give them your full attention. Be careful not to interrupt or offer solutions/personal opinions. Start simple by asking an open-ended empathetic question: “Can you tell me more about what you just shared?” At some point, summarize to show you’ve been actively listening to them: “Let me make sure I understand, you’re saying . . . .” This is your first step toward holding space!
-  Get ready to conduct a sensemaking exercise in your upcoming collaborative modeling session. Once everyone has finished, initiate a discussion with the following inquiry: “Which observation stands out among the results?” Allow the dialogue to flow by asking neutral questions such as these: “Who can somewhat relate to what’s been said?” and “Who sees it differently?” Particularly when there’s a moment of silence, practice the art of stay[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)ing silent yourself.

## 5.7 Chapter heuristics

*Guiding heuristics**[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)*

-  When words and music don’t go together, they point to a missing element.
-  When someone says “this is how we do it here,” you know you’ve found a pattern of their specific culture.
-  If you feel the urge to react to opinions being made, write these down, and reflect on them after the session.
-  If you find yourself feeling drained or exhausted by the facilitation process, it might be an indicator that you’re taking on too much responsibility or don’t have enough skills yet to facilitate that specific session. Facilitation should not be overly taxing.
-  If you find yourself feeling drained or exhausted by the facilitation process, it might be an indicator that you’re taking on too much responsibility or don’t have enough skills yet to facilitate that specific session. Facilitation should not be overly taxing.
-  In scenarios where you’re not the facilitator but have noticed a specific pattern within the group that could help in progressing the session, it’s recommended to share your observation based on your own needs. This approach allows you to contribute constructively without overstepping the facilitator’s role, offering insights that could be crucial for the[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/) group’s advancement.

## Summary

-  A facilitator makes the collaborative modeling process easier for the stakeholders and makes sure the group is responsible for the outcome of a collaborative modeling session.
-  A facilitator is a role not a job title, and anyone from team lead, software architect, software engineer, to product owner, tester, and user researcher can perform the role.
-  During the process, as a facilitator, you take on different stances such as an observer, a coordinator, a coach, an enabler, a counselor, and a task organizer.
-  The three core competencies—neutrality, observing, and compassion—are vital skills as a facilitator and form the basis of all other facilitation skills.
-  Core competencies are culturally and status dependent, as well as dependent on the people allowing you to use them.
-  As a facilitator, you’ll be communicating a lot, that’s why we need to work on our communication skills.
-  Active listening emphasizes the importance of explicitly verifying whether you truly understood the message, verbally and nonverbally.
-  Facilitators need to work on holding space, which means that the individuals in the group have the opportunity to voice their ideas, opinions, concerns, and so on about a topic in a way that makes them feel safe.
-  Turning on the flashlight to make the shadows visible for everyone is hard and difficult, especially when emotions get into the mix, which is often the case when doing sensemaking exercises.
-  By being vulnerable, you can lead by example and hopefully lower the bar for others to also be (more) vulnerable.
-  Not everyone thrives in chaos and uncertainty the same, so the collaborative styles will help us guide them through that liminality.
-  Whether you facilitate remotely or in person, the required skills remain the same. However, there are also differences in the nature of an in-person versus remote session, that you as a facilitator have to account for.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-5/)
