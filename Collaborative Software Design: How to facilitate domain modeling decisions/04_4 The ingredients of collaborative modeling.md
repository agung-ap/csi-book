### This chapter covers

- The collaborative modeling stages
- Sensemaking during collaborative modeling sessions
- The effect of using check-in and check-out
- The collaboration styles you can use during sessions

Our first collaborative modeling sessions didn’t go so well. We were part of a development team, and as a developer, architect, and so on, we could see the huge benefit that collaborative modeling and its tools could bring us, but we had a hard time convincing other people of its power. Mistakes were made along the way, and they were ours. Over time, we adapted and discovered an approach that worked well. In this chapter, we’ll share that approach with you, so you can learn from our experiences (and avoid these mistakes). We’ll describe the following six stages we use to organize a successful collaborative modeling session:

1.  Preparation
1.  Check-in
1.  Modeling with tools
1.  Check-out
1.  Retrospective
1.  Communication and documentation

In this chapter, we’ll first give a brief overview of all the stages. Next, we’ll talk about the preparation that goes into organizing a collaborative modeling session. Then, we’ll cover the importance of sensemaking during a check-in at the start and a check-out at the end of a collaborative modeling session. We’ll teach you how to create good sensemaking exercises, which you need during the modeling exercises to probe the shadows of the group. In chapter 3, we discussed the importance of modeling different options, but coming up with these options isn’t easy. There are a few styles that you can use to kick-start generating options, which we’ll discuss in section 4.5. No modeling session goes perfectly, so we’ll also explain how to evaluate the session and create feedback loops for the following sessions.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.1 The collaborative modeling stages

In the previous chapters, we’ve mentioned the collaborative modeling session many times. The session is where the actual collaborative modeling happens. But, as a facilitator, your job doesn’t start at the beginning of a session nor end when the session is over. There is a lot that needs to happen before a session and after a session is finished. That is why the session is a part of a larger undertaking. Figure 4.1 shows a single flow with all the building stages. There is a good chance that you have multiple of these flows going at the same time, and each flow will be at a different stage.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.1 The six stages of collaborative modeling: prep, check-in, modeling with tools, check-out, retrospective, and communicating and documentation. The collaborative modeling session is a subpart of the entire flow.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F01_Baas.png)

### 4.1.1 Why use our stages?

Introducing collaborative modeling, such as EventStorming, into a company can be challenging. Reflecting on our initial attempt at implementing it in the company we were working for at the time, it turned out to be a disaster. This was due to several reasons:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  We weren’t familiar with EventStorming. We followed a session during a meetup and wanted to try this out in our company, so we had 30 minutes of experience with the tool in total.
-  We invited all the people on the team to participate, who had a total of 0 minutes experience with EventStorming. We didn’t give much context to why we were scheduling this, what the intent was, or what was going to happen. It resulted in a lot of shadows in the group, resistance behavior, and conflicts.
-  We wanted to explore if there was a better way to schedule surgeries, which was a business process of an existing product. This type of exercise isn’t fitting for a first session, which we didn’t know at the time. It’s very hard to let go of how something already works in software. Combine that with very little experience with the tool, and we were in a very difficult situation for a first modeling session.

It might seem that we were really setting ourselves up for failure, but at that point in time, it wasn’t that obvious. Hindsight is a lovely thing to have. Getting good at facilitating sessions takes time and experience. On top of that, you need to teach a bunch of new tools to other people at the same time. Take it from us, that isn’t an easy thing to do. So what should you do instead? Focus on getting to know the tools that will be used during the session. Find a few enthusiastic colleagues that are open to experimenting, and learn the tools together. Once you’ve done that a few times, you can put on your facilitating hat and organize a session.

People are often cautious when it comes to trying out new things. It’s important that the participants leave the session energized and spread the word of how wonderful it is. Word of mouth is the most powerful advertisement you can have when introducing something new. Unfortunately, during your sessions, you’ll be dealing with participants who aren’t that open to new things. Some will be excited, while others will be skeptical. A lot depends on getting those skeptical people to participate in the session, which is why we created this flow of stages that you can follow. It will help you avoid the mistakes we made in our first session, meaning your chances of convincing the skeptics of the power of collaborative modeling have just improved dramatically. You’re welcome[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)!

### 4.1.2 The stages

Alright, let’s get this flow started! As you can see in figure 4.1, shown earlier, there are six stages to the flow. We’ll start by giving you a brief summary of each stage, which you can use as a cheat sheet when you’re putting all of this into action. So, bookmark this page[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)![](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

#### Stage 1: Preparation

As the first stage, *preparation* refers to preparing the modeling session. During the preparation, you’ll perform the following tasks:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  Define the goal.
-  Find a good location.
-  Determine who to invite.
-  Create the agenda.
-  Select the tools and material.
-  Prepare the check-in, check-out, and sensemaking exercises.
-  Define a good outcome.
-  Prepare the sp[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ace.

#### Stage 2: The check-in

A *check-in* is a moment at the beginning of the session where you focus on the participants instead of the goal. The purpose of a check-in is to make the participants comfortable and to start orienting them toward the goal of the sess[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ion.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

#### Stage 3: Modeling with tools

The *modeling with tools* stage is where the actual collaborative modeling happens. This stage can take many forms and have many durations, depending on the goal you set for the session. The tools you’ll be using for a session also depend on the goal. It’s very hard to prepare for this, to be honest, so you might not want to overdo it. You don’t want to hold down the discovery by sticking blindly to the goal of the session. The session goes where the group wants it to go. Discovery is exploratory by nature because you want to examine business problems, try different designs, and so on. Sometimes, it’s hard for a group to keep it going. When that happens, there are *enabling constraints* that you can try as a facilitator to get the group unstuck, a group of these enabling traits are called *collaboration styles*, and we’ll dive a bit deeper into them later in the chapter.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

At the end of the modeling with tools stage, you’ll go into *convergence* mode. Converging here means that you’ll stop the discovery part of the modeling session and start working toward summarizing the discovery and planning the next steps. The group will have to start making decisions:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  What do we explore next?
-  What do we do with this information?
-  Which parts of the discovery do we want to dive into deeper?

Participants will have different opinions here, but the group will still have to make decisions. There is a lot to be said about making decisions in a collaborative way, which is why we dedicated chapter 9 to [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)this topic.

#### Stage 4: The check-out

A c*heck-out* is fairly similar to a check-in. It’s a moment at the end of the session where you focus on the participants again. A check-out does have a different goal from a check-in, however. During the session, conflicts may arise, and, sometimes, the tension gets really high. The purpose of a check-out is to leave this conflict and the session itself at the door when leaving t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)he session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

#### Stage 5: Retrospective

As we mentioned in the introduction, we made a lot of mistakes when we first started collaborative modeling. One of the biggest mistakes we made was not reflecting on the collaboration that had happened. It’s important to understand what went well, what could have gone better, what important knowledge the participants gained, and so on. This *retrospective* stage happens after the session is finished, and it doesn’t include the entire group. We’ll discuss this further in[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) section 4.6.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

#### Stage 6: Communication and documentation

If the absence of a retrospective was one of the biggest mistakes we made, not communicating or documenting the sessions was *the* biggest mistake. As a facilitator, it’s not your job to communicate and document the session, but it *is* your job to facilitate it. During the *communication and documentation* stage, you want to observe and keep track of whether the participants are following through with the decisions that were made and whether these decisions and their results are properly documented. If not, you want to act upon that. Advice on how to do this can be found in chapter 11.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

We know this is a lot to keep in mind as a facilitator, but don’t worry, as this becomes intuitive after a while. You’ll spend less time preparing a session, and you’ll know when to schedule a retrospective and what needs to be communicated and documented. Until that time comes, our advice is to follow the structure we [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)provided for you.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.2 Preparing for a session

The first step of collaborative modeling is preparation (aka prep). Preparation has two meanings here: prepare the content of the session, and prepare the space of the session. We’ll start with digging a bit deeper into pre[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)paring the content.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.2.1 Preparing the content

To have a successful collaborative modeling session, a lot of people want to understand what they can expect will happen during this session and why they were invited. The best way to achieve that is by adding an agenda when setting up the meeting. We created a template (figure 4.2) that will help you with that. Feel free to use it as is, or adapt it to something t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)hat works for you.

![Figure 4.2 Our preparation template for preparing the content of a collaborative modeling session](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F02_Baas.png)

In figure 4.3, you can find the finished template for one of the follow-up sessions we did with BigScreen. Because we were external, we prepared the session with the development team to make sure we were on the right track. It pays off not to do the preparations alone, so invite one or two people to [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)help you with this.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.3 The preparation template of BigScreen’s follow-up modeling session, which we prepared together with the development team](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F03_Baas.png)

#### The goal

Creating the agenda is easier when you already know what the goal of the session will be, so that is where we start when filling in the template. It’s tempting to try and create some excitement or curiosity when setting up the meeting by staying a bit vague on what will happen during a session (especially when it’s the first time), but don’t do that. Being “boring”—aka fully informing the participants—is the right way to go here. Most people already have full agendas, and it’s important to inform them what we get out of the session. Don’t make it too technical either. Remember, not all stakeholders in a collaborative modeling session have a technical background.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

The first session we organized in BigScreen to redesign the Big Ball of Mud was focused on understanding the new campaign. We formulated the goal as follows: “Creating an overview of the most important steps for the ‘Anytime[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/), Anywhere’ campaign.”

#### The people

When you define a clear goal for the modeling session, you can determine which stakeholders to invite for this session. When you look at the goal of the session, ask yourself two questions:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  Which of the stakeholders have the questions for this goal?
-  Which of the stakeholders are able to answer these questions?

You can use the stakeholder analysis from chapter 2 to find the stakeholders. Even though we try to invite the right people, it’s important to know that this will rarely be the case. We never had a session where we didn’t hear: “You would have to ask this person, but they aren’t here.” It’s also one of the reasons why EventStorming has hotspots. With hotspots, you can make it explicit that there is another stakeholder that has the answer to a specific question.

When it came to understanding the “Anytime, Anywhere” campaign, the people who had the questions were the development team, the product owner, and the business analyst. The person who could answer these questions was the campaign manager. We also invited the supervisor of the customer helpdesk. This might seem a bit weird, but we had a very good reason for doing that. During our initial intake conversations, we noticed that the people involved were so focused on the redesign for the mobile app that they lost track of the major problems customers had right now when purchasing tickets. For the campaign to be successful, those problems needed to be dealt with too, so we invited the person who had the[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) answer to that question.

#### The location

When you organize a session, you need a lot of modeling space. An ideal location has a lot of empty walls or a long table that you can use. Unfortunately, the ideal location rarely exists, so you have to make the best of it. The two most important aspects of a room, besides enough modeling space, are temperature and oxygen. When a room is too cold or too hot, attention spans drop, which can make a difference in the effectiveness of the session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

When you’re dealing with a team that mostly collaborates remotely, it’s better to organize these sessions remotely as well. In that case you’re very lucky, because finding a good location isn’t a problem you need to solve. (Don’t get too excited about this, there are other problems that might pop up, such as time zone differences, bad internet connections, bad sound, and people having[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) small screens to work on!)

#### The agenda

When people read the agenda of the session, they need to understand why they were invited. People like to prepare themselves for a meeting as well—that is why we send out an agenda in the first place—so make sure it’s clear what is expected from them. When we created the agenda for BigScreen, we added an introduction to it. The campaign manager and helpdesk supervisor had never spoken to the software team before, so they had no idea who those people were or what their responsibilities were. A lot of companies deal with silo problems in which departments rarely communicate with one another. This is especially true in software development. Make sure you leave room for people to get to know one another, as that will make the rest of the modeling session a lot easier. We also added the topic “Identifying current difficulties when ordering tickets” explicitly, so that Betty from the helpdesk department understood why she was invited and could prepare herself for the session. We also like to send some information up front if we know we will be doing EventStorming or use some other tools, so people have a feeling for what we will be doing.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

After the agenda is finished, you can schedule the meeting. When you send out the invitations, make sure that you add the goal and the agenda in the invite. We like to send out the invite at least a week before the actual session, so people have time[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) to prepare or ask questions.

#### The session

In this step, there are a few things you need to do: prepare the check-in and the check-out, think about possible sensemaking exercises, and select the tools that you’ll use during the session. We’ll discuss the check-in, check-out, and sensemaking exercises, as well as how to prepare for them, in sections 4.3 and 4.4.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Selecting the (possible) tools that you’ll use during the session is important because you need to know which materials you need to bring to the meeting. If you’re organizing an EventStorming session, you need a lot of different-colored stickies and markers. If you want to fill in the Business Model Canvas, then a whiteboard with markers and a wiper are better suited. After a while, you’ll know by heart the fixed set of materials you need to have when modeling. We even have an entire flight case with all the materials we use so we’re always good to go! As a backup, we have some stickies and markers in our backpack. When the session is remote, you’ll need an online collaborati[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ve whiteboard and your favorite [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)videoconferencing tool instead.

#### Definition of success

The *definition of success* refers to a few guidelines, specifically for this session, that allow the facilitator to assess whether they have reached the goal of the session. This definition isn’t shared with the participants because we don’t want our definition of success to turn into a hard objective. Our definition of success for the modeling session with BigScreen includes the following:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  Modeled the happy path of a ticket purchase via website
-  Modeled the happy path of a ticket purchase via mobile app
-  Identified at least three important problems that customers have when purchasing tickets

Don’t turn these definitions into hard objectives, as they represent the ideal future and are just there to guide you during the session. Modeling sessions are a bit unpredictable in nature because you’re never sure what topic will come up. Sometimes, the conversations diverge completely from your initial goal—and that is okay, so long as the group explicitly decided to do so. The guidelines that weren’t accomplished during the session can be used as an input to prepare a ne[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)w collaborative modeling session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.2.2 Preparing the space

When you’re organizing a session, you want as many people as possible to participate in the collaboration. You want them writing stickies, moving stickies, making little side notes, asking questions, and so on. At the same time, for a variety of reasons, people are a bit cautious to participate. You can try to remove as much of the *participation barrier* as possible by preparing the space. Preparing the space for a session is different depending on whether you’re having a remo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)te session or an in-person session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

#### In-person session

When you’re having an in-person session, a good way to lower the participation barrier is by removing the chairs and tables from the room (if you’re not using them as modeling space). When people are already standing up, it’s easier for them to pick up a sticky and hang it on the board. When you remove the chairs completely from the room, it looks more spacious too. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

##### Note

Keep your participants in mind; not everyone can go hours without being seated. In addition, make sure you add regular breaks to the session.

In our early days, we had learned from our first disaster and done an excellent job at preparing the content and the space. We had prepared a beautiful PowerPoint to explain the purpose of this meeting. The stickies and markers were neatly arranged on a small table. We were particularly proud of ourselves because we hadn’t forgotten about the chairs: they were neatly stacked in the corner of the room. The participants started coming in while we were doing some last-minute checks. When we turned around, all the participants were sitting down. One of them had grabbed a stacked chair and every other person in the room had followed their example. The participants were very enthusiastic: they answered all the questions and showed their own PowerPoints to visualize their business processes. They just never got out of the chairs again—no matter what we tried. We never left the chairs in the room after that, except the exact amount for those peo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ple who can’t stand for a period of time.

#### Remote session

Remote sessions have default barriers that you can’t get rid of: all participants are physically removed from one another, some participants struggle with the tools, and so on. This makes remote sessions harder than in-person ones. The good news is that we’ve picked up a few tips to help you with that.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

First, the online whiteboard tool should be easy to use. A few examples of popular whiteboards are FigJam, Microsoft Whiteboard, Lucidspark, Mural, and Conceptboard, and our favorite is Miro. To lower the barrier, you can prepare some easy tips that can help your participants with using the whiteboard. In figure 4.4, you can see our Miro tips. Second, make sure you have clear joining instructions when you send out the invitation. Add a link to the whiteboard you’ll use during the session, with the tips and the agenda already on it. If you added an introduction section to the agenda, prepare a small introduction section they can already fill in before the session. This way, they can already practice a bit with the tool; however, always account for some extra time at the start because not everyo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ne will have time to practice beforehand.

![Figure 4.4 An example of whiteboard tips for the participants. These tips are for Miro specifically, but you can do this when using another whiteboard too.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F04_Baas.png)

Create an initial structure for the group to lower the “empty space” paralysis. When you plan an EventStorming, add some stickies to the whiteboard. Fill some of them in with events, and leave a whole bunch of blank stick[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ies around them, as shown in figure 4.5.

![Figure 4.5 Counteract the “empty space” paralysis by adding some stickies to the whiteboard during a remote collaborative modeling session.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F05_Baas.png)

We try to avoid hybrid sessions in which some people are remote, while others are sitting together in a conference room. It’s an added layer of complexity for the facilitators that is very difficult to deal with. If you can’t avoid hybrid sessions, at least make sure the people who are in the same room each have their own laptop to participate on the whiteboard and preferably have headphones with them so that everyone is joined in the same way. Sensemaking and a good check-in also help to lower the participation barrier[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/), which we’ll discuss in the next section.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.3 Sensemaking

Ever been in a situation where you felt something was going on in a group, but you couldn’t pinpoint what it was exactly? Your gut feeling observed shadows, but you couldn’t really put a finger on it. Maybe you felt tension or sensed frustration within the group. Not addressing it could really hinder conversations, collaboration, and progress. At the same time, addressing it isn’t easy. Social dynamics, power dynamics and psychological (un)safety make it hard to call this out in a group. What if your assumption is wrong? What if the group wasn’t feeling hindered by what you thought you observed? This is a delicate matter that should be handled in a delicate way. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

As facilitators, we find ourselves in situations like this all the time: conversations and decisions that keep cycling back to one specific topic, workshops where some people keep diving into details and others want to stay more high-level, or groups beating around the bush and skillfully avoiding certain topics. These situations can lead to tension, slowing down, and healthy or unhealthy conflict.

*Sensemaking* helps us in getting and providing relevant insights to guide a workshop, meeting, or decision-making effort. It’s also a great way to make shadows explicit to the rest of the group in a neutral, nonjudgmental way and then address them properly. In this section, we’ll dig into what sensemaking is and how to use it, what benefits it brings, [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)and how it helps address the shadows in a group.

### 4.3.1 Conscious and unconscious minds

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Before diving into sensemaking, let’s go back to our mental model. More specifically, the shadows that participants bring to collaborative modeling sessions. Although they seem more in the background at first, they heavily influence the outcomes, social dynamics, and progress of these sessions. There’s more than meets the eye here as ranking, cognitive bias, assumptions, polarities, conflicts, and so on can all live in the shadows of groups and might even turn into demons when not addressed and managed properly. Negative feelings, frustration, or conflict can drag on for too long, becoming bigger and bigger until they can no longer be suppressed and ultimately turn into demons. This is where the facilitator can shine by turning on the flashlight so the shadows become visible. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Our mental model, and way of working, is of course based on other valuable work that was done far before we entered the world of collaborative modeling and facilitation. A very important and foundational theory comes from Sigmund Freud.[1](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/footnote-004) Freud created a model where he describes three levels of the mind—*conscious*, *preconscious*, *and unconscious*—using an iceberg analogy, as shown in figure 4.6. This model is at the foundation of many models we use and know today. The three levels represent the following:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  *Conscious*—The mental processes and sensations we’re aware of. It’s what we can see, observe, feel, notice, and see. We can think about these processes rationally. For example, feeling hungry makes you decide to get something to eat. This is the tip of the iceberg.
-  *Preconscious*—Things you don’t instantly know, but that you can access by association. This lives between the conscious and unconscious mind. It’s some sort of storage, with thoughts and knowledge that waits around to go to the conscious level. It’s about memories that you extract for a specific purpose at a specific time. For example, hearing a certain song triggers memories of your first holiday with friends, or seeing an architecture design pulls up memories and best practices from earlier projects.
-  *Unconscious*—The mental processes that are inaccessible to consciousness, but influence judgments, feelings, and/or behavior.[2](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/footnote-003) Following Freud’s iceberg analogy, this is the biggest and most important part that you can’t see. According to Freud, the unconscious mind is the primary driver for human behavior. The unconscious also contains the more unpleasant parts such as anxiety and conflict. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Now let’s relate this to collaborative modeling sessions. Every participant brings these levels to the session. If most of what goes on in the mind is unconscious but can heavily affect behavior, then that leaves us with a challenge. As facilitators, we need to turn the flashlight on so the shadows become visible. Lots of things in our minds are pushed and oppressed to the unconscious part because we find them unpleasant or uncomfortable, or because we’ve been taught to not have these emotions. The ongoing conflict you have with your manager about the modeling and design process, that one colleague that never stops talking and never listens, those people who only want to talk and model together instead of doing the actual coding are all examples of things that could live in the unconscious mind being suppressed or even oppressed during collaborative modeling sessions. At the same time, they influence how people behave. They influence who speaks and who stays quiet, who shares a minority perspective and who doesn’t, where people stand in the room, the subgroups that arise, and so on. So, it might se[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)em a good idea to address these during a session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.6 Iceberg model that describes three levels of the mind: conscious, preconscious, and unconscious](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F06_Baas.png)

#### Shadows or icebergs?

The iceberg model is mainly about individual perspectives: the unconscious, conscious, and preconscious minds of individuals. Because collaborative modeling is about the group conscious and unconscious, we instead refer to shadows in our mental model. Figure 4.7 illustrates a group and its shadows during a collaborative modeling session. You could see the shadows as the unconscious. Another reason we prefer to use shadows is because an iceberg implies that what’s beneath the waterline isn’t visible. Cognitive bias, ranking, polarities, and so on *are* visible during collaborative modeling sessions; otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to see them as facilitators. So, they might exist in the unconscious, but the shadows of people expose them. The shadows can be subtle and relatively light, or very dark, big, and personal. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

##### Note

For those familiar with Carl Jung and his concept of shadows, we use it differently and more broadly here because we focus on the *group’s* unconsciousness. Carl Jung’s concept of shadows is about an *individual’s* repressed desires, ideas, instincts, weaknesses, and shortcomings that the individual is completely unaware of.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Now when shadows get too big and dark, they might turn into demons that can no longer be (easily) facilitated. As facilitators, we’re looking for these shadows as they influence group behavior. It requires the skill to turn on the flashlight in the right way so the shadows become visible. That’s just the first step though. The next step is to make the shadows visible to the rest of the group and make them small[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)er and lighter to prevent the demons from coming out.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.7 Example of shadows that live in the unconsciousness of the group during collaborative modeling](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F07_Baas.png)

There are several techniques that can help you do that, including using sensemaking exercises, check-ins, and check-outs. Using the iceberg analogy, you would say that you’re trying to lower the waterline and get more of the unconscious to the preconscious and conscious level. In our model, we try to reduce the size and darkness of the shadows by shining a flashlight on them, making those shadows fluid throughout the group. In the next sections, we’ll [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)explain how check-ins and check-outs can help you here. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.3.2 Opening up conversations

What can you do when you feel like there are some potential shadows lurking but they’re not being addressed properly? You have this urge to open up the conversation and shine a flashlight on the shadows to get them out because they’re holding the group back. Maybe you observe a few people being very active and vocal, where others seem a bit more hesitant to share their perspectives. Your gut feeling might tell you to ask the quieter people to speak up and add to the conversation. Whatever you do, *never* put the spotlight on an individual. This might create a very unsafe environment where people won’t share anything or will share what they think is politically correct. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Let’s dive into an example from our BigScreen journey. Shortly after the pandemic measures were lifted, allowing us to do collaborative modeling together in a room again, most of the team was very excited about this. They planned an EventStorming session the week after, and everyone was expected in the office. It was a bit awkward at first, but after the check-in, it started to feel normal. At one point, we as facilitators noticed that some people were distancing themselves from the group and the modeling space, and they weren’t adding a lot to the conversation. What was going on there?

During one of the breaks, we picked up on a conversation about physical presence and how it wasn’t that exciting and comfortable for everyone in the group. As facilitators, this is your cue to bring this back into the group. To address this, we employed sensemaking. We asked the group “How comfortable are you being in the same room?” and then asked them to line up from “very comfortable” to “not comfortable at all.” Turned out the group was divided, and it was causing some friction (“Why are some people distancing themselves; can’t they just join us at the modeling space?”) and frustration (“I’m not going to stand so close to others because my partner’s health isn’t that great”). By asking the question, making the division visible, and opening up the conversation, we could make some agreements that made the session comfortable for everyone. Figure 4.8 shows what that exercise looked[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) like, where people are represented by dots on the line.

This is exactly what sensemaking can bring to a group and session. You can do these exercises at any time or moment during a session. Check-ins and check-outs are also forms of sensemaking with a specific purpose and timing, and it can tell you a lot about a group and their emotions, polarities, and opinions. In section 4.4, we’ll discuss check-ins and check-outs and how to use them during collaborat[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ive modeling sessions. First, let’s dive into sensemaking.

![Figure 4.8 Sensemaking example exercise we did at BigScreen](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F08_Baas.png)

### 4.3.3 What is sensemaking?

*Sensemaking*—as the word suggests—is about making sense of the environment. Beyond the obvious and visible. It’s about getting an understanding of the group and elements in play, and giving meaning to their collective experiences. Sensemaking is very often about the unknown—the beliefs, opinions, worries, and gut feelings that live in a group. Making sense of these—structuring them—helps us act in the unknown. We test a mental model that is based on observations of behavior within a group. We create these mental models based on observations of patterns and behavior within the group and based on experience. Instead of jumping to conclusions and flying blind on assumptions, we test the mental model and make it more complete and accurate by adding data from the group. It’s never about right or wrong. It’s about creating a shared sense of reality and increasing mutual understanding. As mentioned, this is usually about stuff that lives in the shadows—uncomfortable feelings, conflicts, polarities, ranking, and so on that adds to the energy in a room and affects the chemistry—but is hard to grasp. By doing sensemaking exercises, you can make these things explicit and address them accordingly. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

When you’re in a situation that feels off, unpredictable, frustrating, or chaotic, sensemaking helps you to understand the story. Let’s clarify this with a BigScreen example. We were facilitating an EventStorming session for BigScreen, where we tried to discover challenges and opportunities in the software delivery process. Over time, we felt that the discussion kept cycling back to the same unspoken problem. We decided to test our mental model by posing a sensemaking question to the group: “Do we build a standard product or custom-made solutions?” Just by posing the question and asking people to place a dot on a line with one pole of the polarity at each end of that line, we made this polarity very explicit. Figure 4.9 shows the outcomes of that sensemaking exercise.

Uncomfortableness followed. These two beliefs were highly present and important within the company, but rarely spoken about. It formed the basis of many discussions and problems in the software delivery process. Uncomfortablene[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ss slowly moved to relief and long-awaited conversations.

![Figure 4.9 Sensemaking exercise example on what product we’re actually building](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F09_Baas.png)

Sensemaking has helped us more than once to move toward a shared understanding of beliefs and underlying social dynamics that hinder conversation and collaboration, as well as to facilitate opportunities wh[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ere people can say what needs to be said without judgment.

### 4.3.4 Why would you do sensemaking?

Sensemaking can feel like a big hurdle to jump, especially at the start because it can often bring uncomfortableness, vulnerability, and negative feedback from the group as it’s not a very common practice. On the upside, sensemaking can trigger conversations, increase mutual understanding and empathy, provide insights into why certain processes are ineffective, and tell you something about the personal relationships of the people in the room. It lessens the shadows that block effective decision-making. Sensemaking is also a very low-key, simple exercise that doesn’t necessarily require a lot of time and effort unless the triggered conversations necessitate that time and effort. It can also help you make decisions on the process quickly: Do we want to continue the collaborative modeling part, or do we want to move to the coding part? This polarity can be made very explicit by a sensemaking exercise. Then, it’s up to the group to decide, based on the outcome, what the next step is. Sensemaking can prevent endless discussions without decisions.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

As mentioned, sensemaking can be a way to make shadows explicit and make these shadows smaller and lighter. It also helps everyone see the shadows that are there and encourages people to see other (minority) perspectives. In a lot of situations, the group might not notice the shadows that are hindering their progress. In the earlier “What are we building?” example, the group was getting frustrated and irritated, but they didn’t observe the polarity that was hindering them. As facilitators, we noticed that people were talking about different things when trying to create a shared model. That’s where we stepped in, created the sensemaking exercise on the spot, and opened up the conversation. The role of the facilitator is crucial here: you have to sense what’s going on. You don’t have to be right, but it’s up to you to turn the flashlight on and give meaning to the shadows that are there. It could have very well been the case that the polarity we thought we were hearing (standard product versus custom-made solution) wasn’t perceived as such by the group. That all dots would have been on the standard product side. That’s fine as well because then it’s settled and we can move on. So, as a facilitator, sensemaking is also a way of testing your mental models. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Do sensemaking exercises when you get the feeling shadows are in the way.

For the people in the session, sensemaking exercises are very efficient ways of seeing other perspectives and challenging their own. It’s only logical that people sometimes get stuck in what they know, become focused on a small part of the EventStorm, and kind of neglect the rest of the timeline. Or they might try to convince others of the way a certain process works because they haven’t seen it any other way yet. Collaborative modeling is also about creating a shared mental model, meaning among all participants. For that to happen, we have to bring together all the individual mental models that are present. Again, sensemaking is a very helpful tool here. It’s not just about lines and dots, as there are more ways you could do a sensemaking exercise. The following two figures show two examples of other sensemaking exercises that we regularly use. We added them to inspire you to come up with different forms of your own. Different forms have different outcomes and effects. Depending on what you want to achieve with the sensemaking exercise, you can decide which to use. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

First, figure 4.10 shows a triangle that allows people to put in a dot somewhere in the shape. It tells you more about the individual perspectives in the group and if they align. We like to use this form when options are a bit nuanced, that is, when there is no black and white option. All options might be used, but in different frequencies. Some might be valued more than others. Seeing the division of the dots helps open up this conversation both o[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)n how it is now and what people would prefer in the future. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.10 Sensemaking exercise example using three options in a triangle. Using a pyramid offers several advantages: it captures nuanced opinions by providing a middle ground, reduces polarization by avoiding binary opposition, increases the accuracy of sensemaking collection by reflecting a wider range of perspectives, and enhances engagement by better matching individual views.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F10_Baas.png)

The second example, shown in figure 4.11, is an interesting matrix that is a bit less nuanced than the triangle example. In the matrix, people have to make a decision. Sure, they can place their dots near the borders, but it’s a bit more decisive. The options are also more contradictory, which can lead to interestin[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)g conversations on where we are now and where we should be. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.11 Sensemaking exercise example using a four-quadrant diagram](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F11_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)When doing these exercises, it’s the conversation that has the most effect. The visual outcome of the exercise—how the dots or people are divided—is very interesting, but having an open conversation about what we’re looking at as a group adds the most value and is transformative. As facilitators, we always ask the group if anyone wants to share something about why they placed their dot (or themselves) somewhere, or if there is anything that stands out to them by looking at the outcome. The outliers often require the most time to discuss. Perspectives seem to be very far apart, and it’s interesting to understand why that is. We always try to address the outliers if no one brings them up. In our experience, the outcomes provide the group with enough conversation material. As a facilitator, you focus on getting to a mutual understanding, asking questions, listening, and achieving completeness.

So, what if you don’t use sensemaking? Well, then you miss out on a lot of crucial things that influence behavior. When we don’t address these things in a session, they might continue to linger and eventually even turn into demons. And demons are a lot harder to manage than shadows. If you don’t do this, you also hinder the group and its progress. When conflicts or different perspectives aren’t made explicit, you might end up circling back to the same conversations over and over again. Increasing frustration, tension, and delays. So whatever form you use, know that sensemaking exercises can help you in making shadows smaller and[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) lighter. You just have to pay close attention to the signals. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

#### Spoiler alert: vulnerability required

Unfortunately, sensemaking won’t be very effective without vulnerability, which is also why sensemaking is so hard. By answering a question or placing themselves or a dot on a line, people show their colors. It could very well be that some are representing a minority perspective. Are they willing—and feeling safe enough—to share this with the group? Partly, sensemaking helps because it doesn’t require anyone to speak up if they don’t want to. We try to do the sensemaking exercises as anonymously as possible, which is easier in a remote setting because no names are added to the dots. When you’re dealing with an in-person session, you can use blank stickies, but people still need to walk and put their sticky there. You can also ask them to write the number on a post-it, fold it up, and give it to the facilitator. When everyone’s stickies are collected, the facilitator will put them on the boards. The point is that, even then, the minority perspective is included in the complete picture. It provides a more complete picture of the entire wisdom of the group, and a conversation can be started. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Vulnerability can be scary. Sensemaking isn’t about certainty, which is exactly what we as humans love to seek. Moving away from the unknown and ambiguous situations. Sensemaking exercises can be uncomfortable, insecure, and ambiguous. That might make them pretty unattractive to actively seek. Sensemaking can force you to stay longer in those uncertain situations because it makes the shadows explicit. Sensemaking can also feel counterintuitive to the culture of some organizations. This is especially true for cultures that are driven by results and/or driven by hiding from and avoiding conflict, even more so when value is placed on leaders making decisions quickly or being deemed indecisive, for example.

Sensemaking requires you to take a step back and be complete about perspectives instead of jumping to conclusions. Doing that requires vulnerability, leading by example. A powerful question to ask in this light is “Who can somewhat relate to this?” by the showing of hands. When there is a minority perspective being discussed, people often recognize parts of that perspective. That’s why “partly” is a very powerful word in this question. It enables people to show vulnerability and have open conversations that include the wisdom of the entire group.

Now, sensemaking can get you right into the midst of a conflict that has been brewing for a while, so be careful what you ask for! But no worries, in chapter 8, we got your back, where we go deeper into conflict resolution. So, until you read tha[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)t chapter, keep the sensemaking to topics that aren’t so sensitive.

### 4.3.5 In-person or remote?

Nowadays, we work in a mixture of online, offline, and hybrid sessions. Sensemaking, but also check-ins and check-outs, remain truly valuable techniques in all these forms. There are different ways of getting the most valuable insights per form, but the outcomes are similar: triggering conversations by making shadows explicit. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Whether you create a sensemaking exercise online by drawing a line and adding dots like the previous examples, or you ask people to stand in a line in the room, the question and outcome remain the same. Being in the same room might make it easier to have meaningful conversations because you can observe nonverbal communication better and sense the energy a bit easier. As facilitators, we noticed that it’s slightly easier to observe and pick up on (weak) signals when being in physical proximity rather than behind a screen. It’s easier to keep the overview of one room and group, than it is to keep an eye on every (non)verbal signal in all the small images on a screen. When doing sensemaking exercises in physical proximity, the movement itself can also tell you a lot about what’s going on in a group. Who walks up to the line or paper first to take a position, who is waiting for others to go first, and who seems to follow someone else? These could be signals on psychological safety, ranking, and cognitive bias. As a facilitator, these are sometimes even more interesting than the outcome of the exercise itself. Even though this is harder to observe in online sessions, there are still things to look out for: mouse movement, camera’s on or off, microphones on mute or not, who places the first dot, who speaks up first, and so on.

Although it might seem that offline sessions are a better stage for sensemaking exercises, there is added value in doing them online that you can’t get offline. For example, some people feel safer in the context of their own homes. They might feel even more safe to share their opinion and perspectives because they aren’t in close proximity to people they otherwise might find more intimidating. Ranking (see chapter 6) can actually be less present in online sessions. Another potential benefit is that—when desired—the sensemaking can be done anonymously. Placing a dot on a line can be done without other participants seeing who moves where. On delicate matters, this might be the preferred way of entering the conversation afterward. As mentioned, online sessions can lack the ability of observing and experiencing all nonverbal communication that’s going on. Sensemaking can even replace this to some extent, as it makes emotions and opinions explicit. We tend to do more sensemaking exercises during online meetings to account for this. We focus some of the exercises more on the emotional part to make sure we get the chance to pick up on signals.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Whether online, offline, or hybrid, they all require vulnerability. It also takes some time to get comfortable with doing the exercises. We encourage you to start experimenting and trying it out. To give you one more concrete example to try,[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) we’ll explain a premortem sensemaking exercise in the next section.

### 4.3.6 Premortem

We can do all the collaborative modeling we want, but there is still a good chance our projects won’t exactly turn out as we hoped or planned. It’s pretty common to do a *postmortem analysis* on these projects. A postmortem comes from the medical field, where doctors learn what caused a patient’s death. While this is very interesting and valuable, the patient won’t benefit from it. Analyzing what went wrong in a project in hindsight is very useful, but wouldn’t you rather know up front so that a project can be improved rather than autopsied? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

One of the reasons projects don’t turn out as we hoped or planned is that people might feel reluctant to speak up about worries, reservations, or concerns they have regarding the project plan. A decision was made, based on a lot of wisdom in the group, and quite some time was spent on it, so maybe it’s better to just keep quiet. While this is a common thought, it can be very useful to do an up-front analysis of the causes of these worries and concerns. This analysis can help you prevent the early shipwreck of new ideas, projects, and plans. By making it safe to share reservations up front, you can anticipate potential shipwrecks and improve a project’s chances of success. One of the formats we use for this is the *premortem exercise*. This is a form of sensemaking because you’re looking for different perspectives, polarities, potential conflicts, and concerns, that is, stuff that may live in people’s shadows. By doing this exercise, you make shadows explicit, smaller, and lighter.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Risk analysis is nothing new, but the difference here is that we don’t look at the project asking what might go wrong, but we focus on the hindsight perspective asking what did go wrong. It’s a very low-key, simple exercise that isn’t too time-consuming. We start this exercise by setting the stage: ask the group to imagine they are *x* months ahead in time and, by that time, the project has miserably failed. Everyone tried their best, but we ended up with a huge failure. Next, we want to explore three questions:

-  What were our initial goals?
-  What actions did we take?
-  What went wrong?

Everyone writes down their perspectives on stickies, and then we go over them. From an efficiency perspective, this helps us identify potential problems early on and allows us to start preparing mitigation actions. We can prioritize the risks with the group and decide how we want to mitigate them. That’s great, but what’s even better is that we get the chance to hear from the experts themselves and use this wisdom in our project. We’re creating a safe space to share the unpleasant, uncomfortable, and very often negative thoughts and emotions that people often repress because they want to look ahead and keep a positive mindset. This is a chance to actively listen to people, let them feel heard and valued, and learn from them at the same time. This makes a premortem exercise perfect for sensemaking. It could also be a perfect exercise during the first part of a check-out. I[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)n the next section, we’ll take a closer look at check-ins and check-outs. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.4 Check-in and check-out

Imagine your team decided that an EventStorming session would be a valuable exercise. The session is planned, the facilitator is briefed, and the team is excited. You grab some coffee, enter the conference room, and chat with your colleagues. At some point, the facilitator briefly describes what is expected from you in the upcoming 30 minutes: write down Domain Events for everything you know of the process you’re modeling today. You are told to write down one event per sticky and place them on the timeline in the right order, and afterwards you’ll structure the entire timeline together. The facilitator says “GO!” The group looks at each other, moves around a bit, grabs some stickies and sharpies, and the uncomfortableness is painfully obvious. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Spoiler alert: we start our training on facilitating collaborative modeling sessions this way. It’s super uncomfortable—also for us—and doesn’t improve the energy in the group. Questions start popping up, people aren’t comfortable with each other yet, and they feel like they missed an important step. We do this to make a point, not to bully trainees—although they might feel that way at first. The point we’re trying to make is that starting something like collaborative modeling without a proper check-in affects the rest of that session in a negative way.

We always (always!) start our sessions with a check-in, and we always (always!) end with a check-out. It’s a way of really connecting with each other, getting to know each other a bit better, and exploring common ground. Especially in collaborative modeling sessions, these check-ins and check-outs are crucial. All the aspects of sociotechnical systems are flying around, and it’s really important to also focus on the social and cognitive part of such a session.

Check-ins and check-outs are a form of sensemaking with a specific purpose and time. In this section, we’ll dive into check-ins and check-outs: what they are, why they are important, wha[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)t they bring to the group and the facilitator, and what they could look like.

### 4.4.1 What is a check-in and check-out?

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)As highlighted in the earlier example, many people aren’t comfortable jumping right into the content at the start of a session without first having a check-in. This discomfort is often due to wanting to know the purpose of the meeting and to get to know the other participants in the room. This helps in feeling safe and understanding the dynamics of the group. As facilitators, we stress the importance of properly preparing a check-in and check-out for every session. These are specific to the meeting and context, and they demand thoughtful preparation and active listening on the part of the facilitator. Next, we[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)’ll clarify what we mean by check-in and check-out, along with some examples.

#### Check-in

A *check-in* happens before diving into the content. You either start a session with a check-in or do it after the introduction of the day, the agenda, and the goal of the session. It’s a way of connecting with each other on a personal level by getting to know each other a bit better and getting oriented toward the goal of the session. Why are people there? What do they want to get out of it? When is it considered successful? Check-ins help people focus on the session they’re in and the people they’re in the session with. It’s also an opportunity to connect with the content of the session by asking questions on the topic at hand, for example, Domain-Driven Design or collaborative modeling. It’s a great way to see how comfortable people are with what you’re going to do that session[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/). The way we do check-ins, which we describe in this book, is inspired by the Lewis Deep Democracy method.[3](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/footnote-002)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Figure 4.12 shows an example of a check-in we regularly use. We ask people in the room to answer these questions if they want to and to the extent they’re comfortable with. This is an important working agreement in every session: “You have the right to pass.” We never force people to answer certain questions in a check-in or check-out if they don’t want to. However, we do ask them to at least say their name when people don’t know each other. When someone has spoken [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)at the check-in, it becomes easier to start talking later on in the session.

![Figure 4.12 Example check-in we used at BigScreen. We start with a personal question to create more group understanding. Questions 3 and 4 focus on the session’s content, ensuring participants engage and reflect on the topic at hand. Our goal is to avoid opinions on the content and instead delve into what participants know and their questions. Remember to customize your check-in questions for each session and refresh the format regularly to keep it genuine.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F12_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Another important aspect of check-ins and check-outs is that this isn’t a conversation—it’s sharing and dumping. Dumping might sound a bit harsh, but what we mean is that this is a monologue. Everyone gets to dump their thoughts, opinions, perspectives, and feelings, and the rest of the group doesn’t interrupt; they just listen. Facilitators have an important role here to emphasize that this isn’t the place for dialogue but that there will be room to react at the end of the check-in. An overview of characteristics of check-ins and check-outs is provided later in this section.

Check-ins can come in many different forms and styles. Depending on the group’s size, the goal of the meeting, and the social dynamics, you can do a check-in that adds value. In smaller groups, you can take more time per person or do multiple check-ins. When groups are bigger, we like to split them up. Each group will have one facilitator who shares the insights from the separate check-ins afterward. We also choose impromptu networking ([https://mng.bz/BdQl](https://mng.bz/BdQl))[4](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/footnote-001), where people ask each other questions in groups of two and then share with the entire group what they’ve heard.

Performing a check-in and a check-out results in enhanced focus, more personal connections, underlying tensions made explicit sooner, and less gossiping through the grapevine. Here’s an example of how important a check-in can be from our own experience and perspective: Once we facilitated a collaborative modeling session with two facilitators. We did a check-in, but it was pretty superficial, meaning the check-in questions didn’t leave much room for people to share what was hindering participation or focus that day. The questions we asked were limited to weekend highlights and what people were hoping to achieve in the upcoming session. And boy did we learn our lesson that day. One of the facilitators wasn’t very vocal nor assertive in guiding the group toward an outcome. This wasn’t normal behavior, and it frustrated the other facilitator who said, “We are on a deadline here. We need to show our added value, and you’re just standing there letting the group struggle.” After a few hours, during lunch, it turned out that the passive facilitator was in serious pain. The person just got an abscessed tooth removed yesterday, and the antibiotics weren’t kicking in yet. Talking hurt, so it was easier to stay quiet. Knowing that led to empathy and understanding from the other facilitator, and we made agreements on their roles during the rest of the session. Had we done a proper check-in, this probably would have been shared at the start of the day. The agreements could have been made earlier, and no one had to feel frustrated or uncomfortable. So, both for the group and the facilitator(s), doing a proper check-in and check-out is highly important.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Check-ins are also great ways to start a conversation after everyone shares their input; that is, at the moment everyone has shared what they want to share, the facilitator asks if someone wants to add something or react to something. Let’s take a look at the example check-in in figure 4.13. We use this very regularly both as check-in and check-out by the way. (And, yes, they are our lovely cats, in case you were wondering.) It’s a simple way of sensing what’s going on in the group in terms of energy. Although it’s low key, the check-in allows people to elaborate on why they chose a certain cat if they want to. It might turn out that someone had a horrible night of sleep because his child was sick and therefore chose cat number 2, or maybe someone had an amazing party the night before and that’s why she chose cat number 2—same cat, different story. In both cases, the check-in serves a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)s a way to connect with each other and increase understanding and empathy.

We encourage you to start including check-ins and check-outs as a standard aspect of your sessions. For longer sessions (4 hours or more), we account for at least 20 minutes for the check-in and 20 minutes for the check-out. Even in short meetings, a very short (one question) check-in can already add a lot of value. In that case, you could limit the time to 5 minutes and get a lot of information and context you’d otherwise not have. Relevant questions obviously depend on the meeting, but the following are some example questions that you could use and adjust to your context in your next check-in:

-  Why do you want to be here?
-  Why don’t you want to be here?
-  Which three words describe how you’re feeling at the moment?
-  What’s the most important thing for you to achieve today?
-  Is there anything you wanted to say in the previous meeting, but you didn’t?
-  How did you sleep, and how’s your energy level?
-  If we could only agree on one thing in this session, what should it b[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)e? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)
-  Show thumbs up or down based on how you feel the project is going so far.

![Figure 4.13 Example check-in to sense the energy in a group](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F13_Baas.png)

#### Check-out

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Starting with a check-in suggests that we end with a check-out, and that’s exactly what we do! The goal of a check-out is to “detach” from the meeting, the content, and the group to see if there’s anything that needs to be said that hasn’t been said during the session. Provide a safe space to share that in the meeting and not when having drinks afterwards or days later over coffee. We want to prevent people from leaving with negative emotions lingering. If they do linger or weren’t shared, this can affect someone for a while after the session. In essence, we ask people in a check-out how they are leaving the session, if there’s anything left that needs to be said, and if agreements need to be made. It’s also a great way to check with participants about how they experien[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ced the sessions from a content perspective. Figure 4.14 gives an example.

Like the check-in, this isn’t a conversation. It’s sharing and dumping—monologue style. If a dialogue or conversation seems to start, it’s up to the facilitator to remind people of the monologue style or do a climate report if it happens a couple of times (more on that in chapter 8). In the example in figure 4.14, we used stickies. This can be done both online and offline, and after everyone writes something down, we ask if anyone wants to elaborate on their sticky. A check-out can be evaluative and personal at the same time. Questions on the content can be combined with questions on energy level, for example. “How are you leaving this session?” is a very powerful question to ask. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.14 Example check-out we used at BigScreen. Similar to the check-in, always tailor the check-out format and questions for each session. This ensures participants leave feeling comfortable and connected to the session’s outcomes.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F14_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Especially when conflicts arose during a session or emotions were involved, a check-out is a way to really close off one session before going to the next thing that needs attention. Not doing a check-out after an intense session might result in people holding on to negative feelings afterwards, growing frustration, and gossiping. The lack of check-out might affect the outcome of the session too. These negative emotions could be projected on the outcomes and cause the group, or individuals, to perceive the outcome and session as nonvaluable. You want to provide a space and opportunity for people to share what they need to share after a session. Check-outs are meant to do just that. Just like a check-in, a check-out also enables personal connections to be made. Because it’s not a conversation but a monologue, you’re more encouraged to listen to others. If any emotions, concerns, frustrations, or thoughts haven’t been addressed during the session, the check-out provides a safe space to do that.

Check-outs occur in many forms and styles that you can experiment with; impromptu networking or forming a circle to step in and step out of are among our favorites. To inspire you, here are some questions you might consider for your next check-out:

-  How are you leaving the session?
-  Which new insight do you consider most valuable?
-  What will you be doing differently tomorrow?
-  What will you still struggle with?
-  What should definitely be in t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)he follow-up session?
-  Is there anything you want to share/say that you didn’t?

### 4.4.2 Characteristics of a check-in and check-out

Now that you have an idea of what a check-in and check-out are, there are some characteristics that you should know about. These characteristics help you in preparing and leading a check-in/check-out, as well as give you an idea of their structure and course:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  It’s not a conversation; it’s sharing and dumping.
-  Monologue style is used: the person speaking can’t be interrupted.
-  Everyone says at least something (saying you’ll pass is also fine!).
-  Popcorn style is used: everyone does their check-in when they feel like it rather than pointing to people.
-  The facilitator leads by example and starts the check-in/check-out.
-  At the end, the facilitator gives a summary of what has been said.
-  After the summary, the facilitator asks the group what the facilitator may have misse[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)d.
-  The facilitator asks if someone wants to react to something that was shared.

### 4.4.3 Why would you do a check-in and check-out?

We hope the first part of this section convinced you of the value of check-ins and check-outs already, that is, the personal connections, the “formal” start and end of a session, and the safe space to share what participants want to share with the group. The power of check-ins and check-outs is also in their simplicity—just an opportunity for participants to share something about themselves, the agenda, or the meeting in an informal way. The questions can be superficial or more in depth, depending on the goals, group, and social dynamics. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Check-ins and check-outs provide insights into what’s important to the group: emotions, energy, and potentially hindering social dynamics. We can bring the pain forward of the group if we ask the right questions, and we can make the rest of the session go faster. This is valuable to the group, as it makes things explicit and prevents shadows from turning into demons. This is also valuable to facilitators because it tells them where to pay extra attention, where to deep dive, and which conflicts and polarities exist within a group. Based on these insights, you can adjust the course of the session. In essence, it’s a way to put a flashlight on and make shadows explicit and reduce their size and darkness. The smaller and lighter the shadows, the less lingering demons that can hinder progress. When it’s clear which polarities or conflicts are present in a group, you can focus your check-in and check-out on them, so they come to the surface much sooner to be addressed and managed.

So, what if you don’t use check-ins/check-outs? Well, you might end up in uncomfortable situations. Let’s go back to BigScreen and one of their collaborative modeling sessions. The group was in a rush, the pressure was on, and the day really needed an outcome to retain the sponsorship from the management team. The group was more focused on the outcome than anything else, so the check-in got skipped from a time perspective. It wasn’t the most inspiring and exciting session for BigScreen. The goal was to EventStorm a specific part on a process level. There were some disagreements in the group about this process and what it currently looked like. Our goal with that session as facilitators was to get to an agreement and remove ambiguity. Little did we know that the day before, there was a meeting on a related topic, and it wasn’t a peaceful session. It started that way, but after a while, it turned into a conflict that wasn’t resolved at the end of the day. During our EventStorm the next day, we felt tension; people weren’t listening to each other and were trying to convince each other why they were right and the other person was wrong—no conversations, only discussions. The goal of most of the participants apparently was being right, as opposed to our goal of being complete and in agreement. Had we done a proper check-in, we could have addressed this sooner. It would have helped the group and the progress and outcomes of that EventStorm.

This example illustrates how important it is to do a proper check-in and check-out. The connection and understanding would have helped the progress and outcomes of that session. This also shows why it’s so important to have facilitators who make sure to do the important tasks to make a session successful—even if it means there is less time to do the actual modeling because that time is needed for checking in and checking out. A check-out is also an opportunity to explicitly ask for what you need o[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)r to optimize follow-up. In the next section, we’ll explain how you can do this.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.4.4 Capturing feedback through check-outs

A check-out can also be a great way to capture feedback from the group. Both on the content (outcomes, progress, speed, expectations, etc.) and the facilitation (style, exercises, facilitators, etc.). The example in figure 4.14 is a way of capturing feedback on the content of the session. Knowing how people describe the session in just a few words provides valuable insights to the facilitators. Especially if there are follow-up sessions planned, it’s very useful to include at least one check-out that captures feedback. For example, the following check-out question can help you as a facilitator prepare the follow-up session better: “Based on the outcomes of this session, what should we start with in the next session?”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Anoth[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)er very valuable way of capturing feedback without putting anyone on the spot, is the *Wow/How about**?*[5](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/footnote-000) method. You can do this one from very small groups to huge groups because method only requires stickies and some space. On one side of the whiteboard, you write “Wow,” and on the other side, you write “How about?” On the Wow side, people can write down what stands out for them now that the session is done. What was eye-opening, what made them rethink something, and what did they really like about the session? This can be on any topic: content, outcomes, facilitation techniques, group dynamics, and so on. On the How about? side, people can write down things they are still wondering about after the session. How about the follow-up, how about action points, how about communication with the rest of the organization, what about <specific topic>, and so on? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

As a facilitator, you get a nice overview of what’s going well and what should stay, and you’ll get an idea about what’s important for the group to cover in follow-up sessions. Figure 4.15 is an example of a Wow/How about? check-out. You can combine multiple exercises for a single check-out. We often provide two exercises: one focused on making sure[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) people are able to detach from the session a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)nd another one to gather feedback.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.15 Example Wow/How about? check-out](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F15_Baas.png)

##### Exercise 4.1: Design your own check-in and check-out

Now that you know more about check-ins and check-outs, it’s time to design your own check-in and check-out. For one of your next upcoming sessions, try to come up with a relevant check-in and check-out. Make sure it adds something to the session, and experiment with different forms. Make sure to get the check-in and check-out on the session agenda and reflect on it afterward: What did it bring [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)to the session, how did people react to it, and what could you improve next time? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.5 Different collaboration styles for modeling with tools

In the previous chapter, we talked about the different tools you can use during a collaborative modeling session. We use these tools during the modeling with tools stage of a collaborative modeling process. The specific tool you want and expect to use is based on the type of problem you’ll model. As mentioned before, EventStorming is better at modeling a storyline, and Example Mapping is better at modeling a specific moment in that storyline where business rules affect what happens next. We have the same tradeoffs when collaborating as a group during the modeling with tools stage. Adding more people to a group also means more diverse knowledge, possibly more opposite opinions, and definitely more biases. We found out that the larger the group, the harder it gets to collaborate, make sustainable decisions, get more insights, and allow the group to feel included.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)To make the session flow with information and insights, we want to use enabling constraints for discovery. One important way we do that is to use a specific collaboration style in a se[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ssion. In the next sections, we’ll explain the styles you can use in th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ese sessions.

### 4.5.1 Together, Alone

One of the most effective styles in our toolbox is the *Together, Alone* style, which is a well-known principle used in design sprints. In a group, everyone models for themselves the same problem or challenges. Everyone gets a chance to share their knowledge with the group without being disrupted by a discussion with others. After everyone shares their model, we can decide what to do. For example, at BigScreen, we sat down with the team[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) in a Bytesize Architecture Session ([https://bytesizearchitecturesessions.com](https://bytesizearchitecturesessions.com)). In a Bytesize Architecture Session created by Andrea Magnorsky, you take a look at the software architecture and ask every team member to model that out alone. After around 20 minutes, everyone shared their model of the architecture, each one valid on its own. We then decided to use one of the models as the foundation to merge the rest of the models. Eventually, we ended up with one shared model of our architecture, as shown in figure 4.16. Just make sure at the end, you also put down a legend of what the parts mean so that people who could not join can read the model.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Merge on the most complete model, instead of the one that is most accurate.

We like to employ this technique especially when we’re modeling a new problem or scenario, or the group doesn’t collaborate in that setting. For example, when we do EventStorming, we ask the participants to first model a timeline of events as they understand it before merging that timeline into one. Making a timeline for themselves means we did constrict the participants and gave them some structure. We constantly balance how much structure we give compared to the chaos that arises. Remember, the more unstructured chaos, the more chance we have for diverse insights.

![Figure 4.16 An example of using the together, alone style in a collaborative modeling Bytesize Architecture Session](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F16_Baas.png)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Optimize for chaos over structure. We want to postpone giving too much structure to a session because the more structure you provide, the fewer insights emerge.

One thing to keep in mind is the number of people involved. If the modeling is something simple, such as a timeline in EventStorming, you can scale it up to 30+ people. If it’s a model of the architecture, such as in Bytesize Architecture, it’s better to keep it to the size of a team. Although it’s doable to add more people, more[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) time will be required, and you might be better off using any of the following types.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.5.2 Split and Merge

During a complex, in-depth collaborative modeling session, one of our heuristics is to not have groups larger than seven people because decision-making will be much harder in such big groups. One of the styles we use a lot during these sessions is *Split and Merge*, which splits the large group into smaller groups of three to seven people. We can divide the group in two ways, either by categorizing the model or by having each group model the same problem. After splitting, we always do a walkthrough over what the other groups modeled and decide how to continue with merging the models into one.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When modeling an in-depth problem, split groups that have more than seven participants.

For example, splitting on categorization can be done when doing a Big Picture EventStorming. For a Big Picture EventStorming, we stay in the same modeling space, but we can split the timeline using a concept called *pivotal events*. We let the group discover what these pivotal events are. We then decide on some emerging pivotal events we can put on the board as milestones to split on. Figure 4.17 shows an example of a Big Picture EventStorming for the BigScreen company. Here, the Planning Finalized Domain Event is modeled by the group as a pivotal event. When that event happens, only then can customers start reserving tickets. Now the group can split themselves left and right of that event and begin cleaning up. We did this session with around 30 people, so once the group was divided into two groups of approximately 15, we asked them to first model another pivo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)tal event in the group, splitting it up again into smaller groups that fit the size.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.17 Zoomed in part of a Big Picture EventStorming showing how a pivotal event can help split the large group into smaller groups](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F17_Baas.png)

Modeling the same problem is somewhat more straightforward. For example, we take a user story as input for an Example Mapping session. The group in total is 12 people, so we create two to three groups and let the teams self-organize based on diversity of knowledge. Each group does its own Example Mapping in isolation for a fixed amount of time. After everyone is done, the groups do a show and t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ell, and then we merge it together into one Example Mapping and decide what to do next.

### 4.5.3 Small Group Diverge and Converge

When we start to design models for complex business problems, ideas can become diverse. Splitting and merging will be complicated and time-consuming because ideas [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)go in all different directions. When you, as a facilitator, expect this to happen, do a *Small Group Diverge and Converge* instead. Create groups of three to four people to model a design for the same problem. Then, several times during the session, share what has been discovered, and let the group go back to their own modeling space to continue. The difference here between split and merge is that your goal isn’t to merge the models in the end. However, sometimes you can still end up with everyone converging to the same model. We actually prefer to enable the group with this style to create several different models for the same problem. From here, we can start to map out the tradeoffs, as shown in figure 4.18, between the models and decide what to do next, or we [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)could even make what Morgan Jones (*The Thinker’s Toolkit* [Crown Currency, 1998) calls a Pros-Cons-and-Fixes list if we want to get it all out. We’ll discuss more about d[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ecision-making and the Pros-Cons-and-Fixes list in chapters 9 and 11, respectively.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.18 A simple tradeoff exercise filling in why one model has a better tradeoff than the other](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F18_Baas.png)

### 4.5.4 Liberating structures: 1-2-4-All

Merging different models has its challenges in larger groups, especially if you want to focus on gaining insights and giving the least modeling structure possible. For example, during one of our exercises, we ask the participants to build a Lego duck. They get a number of building blocks in different colors but no example. Everyone builds a slightly different duck from the Lego blocks, as shown in the example in figure 4.19. Agreeing on which duck is the “correct one” is impossible, but we can synthesize the charac[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)teristics of a duck by looking at all the duck models to see what they have in common.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

![Figure 4.19 An example of different Lego ducks. Imagine using Lego blocks to make your own duck, would it look like one of the ducks in the picture? Everyone creates a slightly different Lego duck, based on our mental model of a duck. From all those examples, we can distill the characteristics of a duck and create a shared mental model.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F19_Baas.jpg)

With a 1-2-4-All method, we focus on the discovery and characteristics with the goal of learning from them more than merging the models per se. What concepts of the model can we leave out, what can we keep, and what models can we leave behind? When you’re with a large group and want to slowly build up your model toward one specific model, we love to use the liberating structure 1-2-4-All. Liberating structures are a collection of 33 easy-to-learn collaboration techniques you can use in meetings to increase psychological safety and trust, and get more outcomes. You can read more about them at [www.liberatingstructures.com](https://www.liberatingstructures.com) or in the book listed in section 4.9 at the end of the chapter.

In a 1-2-4-All, as shown in figure 4.20, we start again with modeling together alone. Everyone tackles the same problem and builds their own model. Then, after an *x* amount of time depending on how hard the modeling problem is, we let people pair up and discuss their model. From here, we ask them to improve upon their own model with the insights from the other model or even merge them together into one model. Again, after an *x* amount of time, we let two pairs group up together, and do the same thing. We end up with several models from multiple groups, which we share in the group. Now we can start to decide what to do, which we’ll talk more about in chapter 9. If the modeling problem is hard, and the group is large, we might start this ex[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ercise with groups of four, then combine to eight, and finally share it with the group.

![Figure 4.20 How to do a 1-2-4-All with eight people in the room](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F20_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)The original 1-2-4-All is about generating ideas, and we can also use it for that. For instance, we can ask the group what opportunities they see on our finished Big Picture EventStorming. Each person gets 2 minutes to generate ideas for themselves. After these 2 minutes of silence, we let people go in pairs, sharing the opportunity and similarities with each other and developing new ideas. Then after roughly 2 minutes, we let the couples become foursomes, doing the same. In this round, we asked each group to let every single person in the group pick one opportunity that stood out for them. After 4 minutes, every person will get 30 seconds to share their opportunity and show and tell them where on the Big Picture that opportunity is in the timeline. We end up with the most significant opportunities of the session, and we can start to decide which one is the most important.

A tradeoff when using 1-2-4-All, however, is that we also leave many ideas behind. We explore different models to gain a deeper understanding, but not all models go beyond exploration. Participants don’t always understand that it’s about the gained knowledge of modeling, and not about the end result—the model, itself. During a session, you’re generating models and abandoning them. This is innate to designing boundaries or models, and many people aren’t accustomed to that, especially in the beginning.

Social ranking is involved in 1-2-4-All, and we ask you to be careful doing these sessions when the culture is hierarchical and when psychological safety is low. We can mitigate a lot by determining the groups as facilitators instead of letting the group self-organize. Doing so wi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ll put you into the group dynamics of social rank, which we’ll discuss more in chapter 6.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.5.5 Ensemble

Sometimes we have just the right tool for tackling a problem, but there is an experience or knowledge gap between the people in the group. For example, running an in-depth process model EventStorming on an in-depth complicated part of a business process might require using all the different concepts of EventStorming. Starting EventStorming with just domain events is great for easy and inclusive discovery with multiple stakeholders. But that might not be sufficient if the process is complicated and only one person knows it. So, we can play by the rules of EventStorming, using all the concepts, and constrict the modeling. A tradeoff is that at least one person needs to understand the concept of EventStorming to not let it constrain the modeling too much. And you don’t want people who know that difficult part to be busy with how to model it because their experience with EventStorming is low. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

This is when we start to use the *Ensemble* style collaborative modeling. As shown in figure 4.21, it’s based on Ensemble (formerly known as Mob) programming, where we one person, called the *driver*, captures and writes the conversation on stickies. Then, have another person, called the *navigator*, who decides what the driver needs to write down during EventStorming based on the group conversation. The rest of the group is having a dialogue about what to model. Depending on the experience and knowledge, we might switch these roles regularly. Facilitators are either facilitating the group discussion in the group as navigator or can take the driver role. It’s also possible to permanently be the driver, and we only change the role of the navigator so that the group can focus on discovery together. The benefit is that when the other people in the group don’t know how the tool works, you take away the learning curve for the group and focus on collaborative[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) modeling. Ensemble is also the default facilitation type when doing Domain Storytelling.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

A tradeoff of Ensemble is that the conversation can go either too quickly to capture or starts diverging from the use case that is discussed. We don’t advise you to use it for discovery or design where the conversation diverges and becomes too much for one person to capture. There is a thin line between modeling the current situation and discussing how it should work. We advise you to spot this quickly and switch to a different type when ne[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)eded. Especially when the group gets too large, say above seven, Ensemble isn’t the way to go.

![Figure 4.21 Example of ensemble modeling showing the roles and setup based on Ensemble programming](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH04_F21_Baas.png)

### 4.5.6 Fishbowl

When the group is too large, and we don’t have enough experienced modelers in the group, we can do a *Fishbowl*. The Fishbowl collaboration style is based on the user experience fishbowl from liberating structures, which 1-2-4-All is also part of. We create one group of around three to six people who will do the modeling together for a fixed amount of time, and we let the rest of the group stand around that group only observing. The observing group can make notes or write down any insights they gain, but they can’t barge into the discussion. At the end of the fishbowl style, the observing group shares the insights, and then we can see if the group is ready to do a split and merge style or a diverge and converge style.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Using the Fishbowl, you can quickly show how the modeling goes and what is expected of the exercise, which can be very important for many people. So, if you think a group is hesitant about a specific exercise, switch to a Fishbowl exercise. Sometimes, people observing can have insights that can be critical for the modeling group.

There are two variations of the Fishbowl that can help, as depicted in figure 4.22. One is to let people from the observing group step in for a timebox of 2 minutes where they can present the insight and then go back as observers. A second is that the person from the observing group can become a modeler themselves, and then someone from the modeling group needs to become an observer. We like this varia[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)tion the most because the observing people can join in and take responsibility for the model.

### 4.5.7 Anarchy!

Sometimes you deal with an experienced team that is mostly equal in knowledge and ranking and has been working together for a long time. The best way to do a collaborative modeling session for these teams is by anarchy. Anarchy style means we’re not using any facilitation of the styles and tools; we let the group figure out how to do it. This implies that someone in the group has enough knowledge of collaborative modeling, and the rest of the group is quick to pick up. The main role of the facilitator then is to spot what happens in the shadows, which is more difficult with an experienced team, perhaps the hardest because the shadows are very subtle. But as mentioned before, the chaos of these sessions and self-organization will provide powerful insights and deeper models. You might believe your role as a facilitator is minimal in this case. Still, we believe even the most hig[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)h-performing teams require reflection and facilitation to get all the wisdom and potential out.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) We used this style ourselves when collaboratively modelling this very book![](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

### 4.5.8 Guerilla

Guerilla modeling isn’t actually a collaborative modeling style you’ll use during a prepared collaborative modeling session, but it’s a style to get buy-in to do collaborative modeling. So, when we have difficulty getting people together in a room or are in a m[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)eeting where we talk about complex problems but aren’t doing collaborative modeling, we deploy the Guerilla style approach. We start modeling for ourselves as facilitators. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

For example, one of the authors consulted a team that depended on many other teams’ data for proper testing. Talking to every team gave a different perspective of the architectural landscape and where the data came from. Although a collaborative modeling session was the best way to understand that and make decisions on how to move forward with the dependencies, no one had time or interest or saw the problem we experienced as a team. So, I set up shop at the coffee corner and hung a paper roll next to it. Then, started modeling the landscape version and put out all assumptions, especially making intentional mistakes to draw people’s attention. Within no time, it grabbed the attention of the other teams who passed by to get some drinks at the coffee corner. They started asking questions because they noticed the systems they were working on. I explained what I was doing and got them to do collaborative modeling with me. Just standing there for 4 hours and having people jump in and out of the session got the outcome we needed as a team to move on. Be sure to share the results with the rest of the teams as well afterward.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Be the least informed person in the room. To get people engaged in the session, ask questions you know are wrong. People love to tell you that you’re wrong and correct you, starting the engagement.

You can do something similar for a meeting you’re in, which isn’t prepped as a collaborative modeling session. For example, when talking about a complex problem for around 5 minutes, going back and forth about the storyline, share your screen and start modeling the conversation. Of course, we can only do this if we have enough ranking in the session, which we’ll talk about in chapter 6. If it’s acceptable, you can now begin to facilitate by asking questions and making mistakes. Within no time, you have people on board, and you might switch to an Ensemble style quickly or get everyone on that tool.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Start visualizing the conversation that takes over 5 minutes. When people can’t set[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)tle on a storyline or have a lot of confusion for about 5 minutes, start visualizing the storyline.

### 4.5.9 The secret modeler

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)The secret modeler, which was coined to us by Ben Monsoir ([https://learnwardleymapping.com/](https://learnwardleymapping.com/)), isn’t at all a collaborative modeling style but more of a tactic. We get a lot of questions from people on how to start and learn to use the collaborative model tools, and one tip we give is that you can always model a conversation or meeting for yourself. Suppose you expect a particular meeting will be a good fit for collaborative[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/) modeling, but you don’t have the authority to organize it. In that case, you can start to become a secret modeler. In a physical meeting, just pop out your notebook or a Bambook, which is a personal A4 whiteboard. Now just begin modeling the conversation. You can keep it simple and just use boxes and arrows to do this. Putting out a paper roll and starting to do EventStorming in a meeting isn’t so secret. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

But for online meetings, you can pop open Miro and have all the space you need. With the model visualized, you can ask powerful questions. Eventually, people might start noticing you as the person who always asks the most insightful questions because you just visualized the landscape of the conversation. Like Simon Wardley mentions in his blog post “On Being Lost” ([https://mng.bz/67PZ](https://mng.bz/67PZ)), you now have an actual chessboard in front of you while the rest are playing chess without the board visible. For example, one of the authors used EventStorming during a presales meeting to model the other person’s needs. Using hots[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)pots as a powerful tool to ask questions, the author understood the problem and saw how best to help.

##### Exercise 4.2: Be a secret modeler

At your next meeting, where you know you’ll be sitting around a table without any form of visualization going on, try to be a secret modeler. Wardley Mapping is our favorite way, but just visualizing any way you can is majorly effective! See what insights and questions pop up before and after the session that you normally won’t get from such a session. It’s the perfect opportunit[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)y to get some practice with any of the collaborative modeling tools before you use them in a session.

### 4.5.10 How to use the styles

Preparing what style to use won’t be necessary for short collaborative modeling sessions, and you’ll probably follow the same style you used before. For example, for a basic EventStorming, you’ll start with the Together, Alone style. First, you let everyone write down their own stickies. Then, for the next step, enforce the timeline, everyone will merge the timeline together into one, and you can decide what to do next. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

Sometimes, you’ll need to use another style during a session. For instance, during a software design EventStorming, people will come up with two competing storylines. We then go back to Small Group Diverge, Converge to work out these timelines. We end up having several models for the same problem. We can now analyze the tradeoffs and decide what to do next.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Change the collaboration style when you’ve been using the same style for a while with the same group.

However, for a full day of collaborative modeling, you want to be more prepared to set yourself up for success. You might also use several tools during the session to get the desired outcome. For each section of the day, you can already think about what style you can use when a specific situation pops up. Especially when you’re unfamiliar with one particular style, we advise you to be better prepared for what can happen. In addition, a very good heuristic to keep in mind from Sharon Bowman’s *Training from the Back of the Room* (Pfeiffer, 2008) is “Different trumps same.” In other words, if you’ve been running several collaborative modeling sess[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ions with the same group and the same style, changing the style might bring new insights and learning.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.6 Retrospective

After letting participants know what they can expect next, and everyone has checked out, we officially close the session. Sometimes, we might all end the day together, enjoying a nice cup of tea or other drinks. Before everyone leaves, we usually bring out a flipchart and ask people to share their thoughts on it. This might include what they thought went well, and any questions they still have. Or, we might create a sensemaking exercise with three scales focusing on return on time invested, content, and structure. We also tell them that this is optional and that we’ll send an email the next day with more information and a way for them to give feedback. It’s important to be careful about asking for feedback directly in the group to avoid putting anyone in the spotlight as mentioned earlier. People will provide feedback when they feel ready. If you push for it and put them on the spot, the feedback you get might not be accurate. We prefer quality feedback over a large quantity of potentially inaccurate feedback. Sometimes, not receiving any feedback is okay and understandable. If people don’t give feedback, it could mean many things: they might be under pressure, be afraid to speak up, or perhaps thought the sessions were excellent.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)Now the participants usually leave, and you end up with the persons involved in setting the meeting up. You clean up together, take pictures of the visuals when working with a physical space, and talk about how the session went. Online usually means everyone leaves the video session, and the ones left are these same people. Now we share the insights we had about the concerns, quickly evaluate what people gave for feedback, and d[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)iscuss a follow-up to reflect on the session. It’s time to start a retrospective of how the session went.

### 4.6.1 Evaluating the outcome of the session

The goal of a retrospective is to reflect on the collaboration that occurred. It’s important to understand what went well, what could have gone better, what important knowledge the participants gained, and so on. So, the first thing you want to do as a facilitator when you have the chance is to take some time to write down your thoughts about the session. What did you observe? What topics did you hear? What is your own feeling about the session? What were the insights after the people left during your discussion with others? Doing this is vital because those first insights and feelings are the ones you might lose and be gone forever. You want to take at least a day to reflect on yourself about the session before you pick up evaluating the session. Your first thoughts are valid but can be based on bias, which we’ll discuss later in the book. You want to dump these.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

With all the gathered input from the session, you can make sense of what has happened and start to reflect together with the persons involved. You want to discuss what everyone thought about how the session went. What went well? What could we do better next time? What are the concerns we have for a follow-up? Is there something we need to communicate to the group? What can we do with the outcome of our premortem? It’s essential to ensure all the concerns are addressed that the group mentioned. If we make a decision during the meeting, we want to ensure people can actually work on it. We want to discuss how we can ensure that everyone can execute the decisions and how we can follow these up.

Another possibility is that we need a follow-up, perhaps because we couldn’t complete the session. So, we start our collaborative modeling process and fill in the canvas. Is there something we need to do differently this time? Perhaps some unspoken shadows are left that need to be addressed before we start a new session. Are we worried about certain people in the group? Are they feel[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)ing okay? What was their feedback? Do we already need to document something or communicate it to the group?

### 4.6.2 When we don’t do a retrospective

Often, we may forget to do a retrospective or decide not to do one. We might feel that the session’s outcome was determined, decisions were made, and these are now acted upon. It’s possible that just by doing collaborative modeling, things have already changed. People act slightly differently and are in a different state of mind because they are removed from the environment they are usually in. They were in a pressure cooker. The minute they return to work, they return to business as usual. You can’t change the behavior of a group or company with just one workshop. We can do a lot in one day, but we need to break and do more to change the unwanted behavior in the organization that can keep a group or team from moving forward. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

When we don’t do a retrospective, we might have a short gain, and everything just after seems to go fine. But the next time you’ll do another collaborative modeling session, people will start to wonder, did we actually do something with it? Did we actually change something, or will this be another worthless waste of our time and nothing happens as a follow-up. We want to know what people think about the session. We want to catch that feedback early so that we can adjust with the group to determine what’s required to get the outcome they need. Sometimes, collaborative modeling just doesn’t work, which is fine because there are many reasons why people aren’t ready to use it. At the very least, we want to know why it didn’t work for them so we can deal with the socia[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)l dynamics and make it safe to fail. You’ll learn more on all of these social dynamics in upcoming chapters. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

## 4.7 Collaborative software design catalysts

-  For your next meeting, let the participants engage in an impromptu networking check-in. As a topic for the impromptu networking, you can discuss any questions that they have on the topic of the meeting. Having some coffee and snacks during impromptu networking helps to make people more relaxed.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)
-  At a halfway point of a collaborative modeling session, do a sensemaking exercise. Encourage participants to evaluate how confident they are that the group will reach the goals at the end of the session, by rating their confidence on a scale from 1 to 10. Invite those in the group at various points on the scale to give feedback, and decide together if we should make changes to the session.
-  At the end of a meeting, initiate a sensemaking exercise. Encourage people to evaluate the effectiveness of the meeting in terms of reaching its goals by rating it on a scale from 1 to 10. Invite those in the group at various points on the scale to give feedback, and inquire what would help them move closer to a 10. This feedback can serve as valuable input for planning the next meeting.
-  When you’re running collaborative modeling sessions with several groups in breakout sessions, it can be challenging to ensure that everyone knows what they need to do. Before moving into the breakout exercises, start a Fishbowl style exercise with one of the groups. Have the other groups watch and write down any questions they have. After 5 to 10 minutes, stop the exercise to [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)answer these questions. Once all questions are addressed, then allow everyone to move into their breakout groups.

## 4.8 Chapter heuristics

*Guiding heuristics*[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)

-  Do sensemaking exercises when you get the feeling shadows are in the way.
-  Merge on the most complete model instead of the one that is most accurate.
-  Optimize for chaos over structure. We want to postpone giving too much structure to a session because the more structure you give, the fewer insights emerge.
-  When modeling an in-depth problem, split groups that have more than seven participants.
-  Be the least informed person in the room. To get people engaged in the session, ask questions you know are wrong. People love to tell you that you’re wrong and correct you, starting the engagement.
-  Start visualizing the conversation that takes over 5 minutes. When people can’t settle on a storyline or have a lot of confusion for about 5 minutes, start visualizing th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)e storyline.
-  Change the collaboration style when you’ve been using the same style for a while with the same group.

## Summary

-  There are six stages in our collaborative modeling: preparation, check-in, modeling with tools, check-out, retrospective, and communication and documentation.
-  As a facilitator, it’s important to prepare both the content and space for a collaborative modeling session. It helps participants understand the goals, their roles, and the desired outcomes of the session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-4/)
-  Preparation of the space depends on whether the session takes place in person or remote. In-person spaces should encourage people to stand and move around most of the session, where remote sessions require a well-prepared online whiteboard.
-  Sensemaking is a technique you can use to get and provide insights into perspectives, emotions, concerns, polarities, and (potential) conflicts within a group that are beyond the obvious and visible.
-  As a facilitator, sensemaking helps in guiding a session or decision-making process. For the group, sensemaking helps them see other perspectives and challenge their own to come to a shared mental model.
-  Sensemaking is a powerful way to make shadows in a group explicit and dive into the group unconscious. Doing this prevents seemingly minor conflicts, disagreements, or negative emotions from growing so big that they will hinder progress and outcomes of the session.
-  A premortem exercise is a form of sensemaking and a way of doing up-front analysis of a failed project. The hindsight perspective forces you to think of what *did* go wrong, instead of what *might* go wrong.
-  Check-ins and check-outs are a form of sensemaking with a specific purpose and time. You focus on the participants instead of the goal of a session. They can help with focus, personal connection, underlying tension made explicit sooner, and less gossiping through the grapevine.
-  A retrospective is usually done with a subset of the group, that is, the people who were involved in setting up the session. The goal is to evaluate the outcome of the session and decide if a follow-up is needed.
-  We described eight collaboration styles that you can use in a session, depending on what you want to achieve. The styles can be used while using the earlier described tools such as EventStorming and Example Mapping. In your preparation, you can think of the tools and style you want to use when specific situations pop up.
