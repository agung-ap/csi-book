### This chapter covers

- Managing polarities, instead of trying to solve them
- Using polarity mapping to manage a polarity
- Managing a polarity for the group

Have you ever faced a problem that felt extremely hard to solve because there seemed to be no clear solution, but rather something that needed to be balanced over time? If so, you were probably facing a polarity instead of a problem. Sometimes problems have one solution: we’re either going left or right. We’re either going to hire person A or person B for this job. But some problems seem less straightforward: Are we focusing on the short or long term? Are we working on this project individually or collectively as a team? It might be tempting to go with either one of the alternatives because who doesn’t like simple clarity? But the latter examples are actually not problems that have an either/or solution. They are polarities that need to be managed in a both/and manner.

This chapter will define polarities and how you can spot them in the wild (more specifically, during collaborative modeling sessions). We’ll also explain and teach you how to address polarities with a group by visualizing them in a map. Based on common polarities during collaborative modeling, we’ll explain how to manage them using BigScreen examples. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

## 10.1 Polarities: Some problems can’t be solved

Imagine you’re working hard on a project for a while that will continue for a few more months. After a long day, you’re tired and just want to lay down and close your eyes or kick back with a nice book to give your mind some rest. However, you also know that a nice workout will help you release stress, clear your head, and provide some energy. With the prospect of this stressful project running for at least another few months, what will it be: Rest or activity? Work out or relax to make it to the finish line in a sane way? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Although this might seem like a problem with an either/or outcome, it’s actually a *polarity*: an ongoing problem or challenge that has no clear solution in terms of picking one of two sides. It’s a problem that can’t be solved because you’re not dealing with either/or, but rather both/and. So, when you feel like the problem you’re facing is something that you’ll need to balance over a period of time—such as focusing on the long term or short term—you’re dealing with a polarity. In a specific moment, you can choose one alternative over the other, but the challenge will come back sooner or later. Rest and activity form an interdependent pair that needs each other over time. You need the benefits of both sides (activity and rest) to function in an optimal way and get through this project without burning out. You want to maximize the benefits of both sides and minimize the downsides of both.

This is an example of a polarity you could experience in your daily life. There are actually many more polarities that we tend to treat as either/or problems (we can only pick one), where we should treat them as both/and polarities that we can manage. In this section, we’ll elaborate on what polarities are and how you can spot them[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/).

### 10.1.1 What are polarities?

Start coding or continue modeling? Centralized decision-making or decentralized decision-making? Planning or action? Stability or change? All of these are examples of polarities that need to be managed instead of problems that can be solved. With polarities, it seems or feels you have to pick one of the two: you’re either going to start coding or continue to model for a while. We’re either going to strive for stability in this project or we’re embracing change and the wobbliness that might come with it. In fact, you need to manage this polarity by knowing when to strive for stability and when to let go to embrace change to stimulate new ideas, get unstuck, and boost creativity. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Polarities are ongoing problems or challenges that have no clear solution in terms of picking one of two sides. We often see groups trying to solve polarities with problem-solving skills that are aimed at choosing one over the other. Trying to solve polarities that way might even make things worse because polarities are interdependent pairs that need each other over time. In other words, you can’t choose one over the other permanently. You have to know how to manage the polarity so you can maximize the benefits of both sid[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)es.

### 10.1.2 Recognizing polarities

Distinguishing problems to solve from polarities to manage can be really hard. Ever been in a situation where you were focused on and racing to produce short-term deliverables to make sure outside pressure didn’t increase, while long-term goals went unaddressed because of it? Or your team wants to invest in interpersonal relationships because that’s highly valued, but the team also wants to deliver products, which already takes up almost all of their time? You know you want and need both, but it sometimes feels like you have to pick a side. If you experience this feeling, that’s how you know you’re dealing with a polarity that requires both/and thinking, instead of a problem that has an either/or solution. To clarify the distinction between a problem and a polarity, consider the following:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

-  A *problem* has a solution. There is a right, or at least best, answer to the problem you’re facing.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)
-  A *polarity* is an ongoing problem or challenge that needs to be managed. It contains seemingly opposing ideas that are actually complementary and interdependent. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When you encounter a difficult dilemma, ask yourself whether this a problem we need to solve or a polarity that we need to manage.

Unmanaged polarities within a group can lead to recurring conflict. As we mentioned earlier in this book: conflict isn’t a bad thing, as long as it’s functional. The moment it gets dysfunctional—which can happen with unmanaged polarities—you’re in trouble. This is why it’s crucial to recognize polarities and determine whether you’re dealing with a problem that needs to be solved or a polarity that needs to be managed. There are two helpful questions we ask ourselves when we try to figure out which of the two we’re dealing with:

1.  *Is the difficulty ongoing?* Are you facing a problem or challenge that has a clear endpoint and right—or at least best—answer? Then, you’re dealing with a problem you could solve. For example, “Are we going to restaurant A or restaurant B for dinner?” is a clear either/or problem. If you’re facing an ongoing challenge that requires balancing seemingly opposite ideas, you’re dealing with a polarity. For example, “Should we race to deliver short-term results to keep shareholders off our back, or should we work on our long-term goals that will increase quality?” isn’t an either/or decision, but rather a both/and challenge. You want to do both. It’s just difficult to know when to move from one side to another and balance both sides. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)
1.  *Are there two poles that are interdependent?* First determine whether or not you’re dealing with two poles that are seemingly opposing. Individual versus team focus, working remote or working on-site, and innovation versus efficiency are all examples of seemingly opposing poles. The two poles in these examples are complementary and interdependent—they need each other over time. Going back and forth between the poles is what will help us manage the polarity. When it comes to problems, there is no interdependency between possible solutions. The solutions can stand alone to be effective. We’re either going to restaurant A or restaurant B. One doesn’t need the other to be effective. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Table 10.1 summarizes the differences between problems and polarities that we just discussed. Use it to ask yourself which one you’re deal[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ing with.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

##### Table 10.1 Distinction between problems and polarities[(view table figure)](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/HighResolutionFigures/table_10-1.png)

| Problems to Solve | Polarities to Manage |
| --- | --- |
| <br>      <br>       Are not ongoing  <br>       Have a right (or best) answer  <br>       Have a clear endpoint  <br> | <br>      <br>       Are ongoing  <br>       Are unsolvable  <br>       No clear endpoint  <br> |
| <br>      <br>       Alternative solutions are independent.  <br> | <br>      <br>       Both sides are interdependent and complementary.  <br> |
| Alternative solutions are opposites: <br>      <br>       Should we go to restaurant A or B?  <br>       Should we invest thousands of euros into this technology?  <br>       Should we add an architect to the team?  <br>       Are we going to buy a new coffee machine?  <br> | Sides are seemingly opposite, but aren’t: <br>      <br>       Short term AND Long term  <br>       Individual AND Team  <br>       Innovation AND Efficiency  <br>       Stability AND Change  <br> |

Once you’ve established that you’re dealing with a polarity, managing it properly is your next step. As a facilitator, there are several things you can do. Section 10.2 provides insights into a technique that helps you visualize the polarity in a polarity map. In any case, it’s important to recognize the polarity and distinguish it from a problem. To manage polarities effectively, you must be able to see both perspectives at the same time to be complete in your perspective. Section 10.3 dives into this more. First, however, let’s consider some common polarities you’ll run across in collaborative modeling.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

### 10.1.3 Common polarities in collaborative modeling

Collaborative modeling is a sociotechnical activity, as you probably realize by now. We put people together in a room and expect them to come up with some sort of an outcome, whether it’s a model, a solution, a design, or a plan. All kinds of problems pop up during collaborative modeling sessions: Did we dive into enough detail to decide on boundaries here? Should we just start coding now and then see if we need to go back to modeling? Should we continue talking about the tasks at hand or focus on relationships and discuss how we feel about where we’re going? Should we deep dive into individual challenges or only focus on the collective? And as a facilitator, are you maintaining control of the process, or are you empowering others to take the lead? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Polarities are present within the group, within individuals, and within (or between) the facilitator(s). As a facilitator, you have to be able to spot potential polarities and determine what you’re going to do with them. Not all polarities need to be addressed during a session. Although they might be relevant, addressing and visualizing them right there and then might not bring any added value. Spotting polarities, validating them with the group, and then letting the group decide if it’s worth addressing them (via visualization) on the spot is our usual approach.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When you, as a facilitator, spot a polarity, validate it with the group, and then ask the group, “Would it add value to dive into this polarity right now (by visualizing it)?” [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

We’ve seen a polarity or two when facilitating collaborative modeling sessions. Table 10.2 shows some of the most common ones we’ve encountered. Let them be pointers for you when you’re spotting polarities in the wi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ld.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

##### Table 10.2 Common polarities in collaborative modeling[(view table figure)](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/HighResolutionFigures/table_10-2.png)

| One Side of the Polarity | The Other Side of the Polarity |
| --- | --- |
| Planning (collaborative modeling) | Action (coding) |
| Individual responsibility | Organizational responsibility |
| Stability | Change |
| Thinking fast | Thinking slow |
| Autocratic decision-making | Democratic decision-making |
| Centralized | Decentralized |
| Discussion | Dialogue |
| Toughness | Empathy |
| Part (e.g., individual) | Whole (e.g., team) |

| Bottom-up | Top-down |

### 10.1.4 Crusaders and tradition bearers [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

As mentioned, it’s crucial to be able to see both sides of the polarity if you want to manage it effectively. That’s where it often goes wrong. We humans have this tendency to be right. And—whenever possible—explain to others why we’re right and others are wrong. With polarities, however, there is no right and wrong because it’s not either/or, it’s both/and. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

If we don’t put in the effort to see both sides of the polarity, we’ll never be complete, which is exactly what we’re aiming for with collaborative modeling: creating a complete and shared sense of reality among all involved. This means everyone needs to see both sides of a polarity when it pops up during a collaborative modeling session. As soon as we become solely focused on being right and convincing each other, we’ll never be complete.

Before we dive into common polarities in collaborative modeling and show you how to fill in the polarity map, we want to explain the role of crusaders and tradition bearers in polarities. In some cases, discussions on polarities can become very heated. People may have very strong opposite opinions that might lead to conflict. In Barry Johnson’s *Polarity Management: Identifying and Managing Unsolvable Problems* (HRD Press, 2014), he talks about how crusader and tradition-bearing forces push for a shift from one side of the polarity to the other. In a polarity, there are *crusaders* and *tradition bearers*: [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

-  *Crusaders*—Those who focus on what needs to change and want things to be different from what they are now, pushing things to the other pole. It’s time to move to the other side because we’re getting too much of the negative effects of the current side.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)
-  *Tradition bearers*—Those who focus on the power of what is working the way it is right now in the current pole. They aren’t in favor of moving to the other side because it might bring all the negatives of that side. Their motto is “If it’s not broken, don’t fix it.”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

You can imagine they are on opposite sides in a polarity. They focus on the positives of the side they are on and fear the negative aspects of the opposite side of the polarity. So, both fail to see the positives of the other pole because they experienced the negatives of the opposite side. This is problematic because the goal of managing a polarity is to stay as much as possible in the positives of both sides of the polarity.

When things are heated, both crusaders and tradition bearers might refuse to look at the polarity from the other side because they aren’t willing to see the complete picture and understand the opposite perspective. This is a problem because a polarity needs both sides to exist, and we need to find a proper balance between the two si[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)des. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

## 10.2 Visualizing a polarity

As consultants, we come across polarities all the time. We actively look for them because we know managing them properly can help a group. Polarities hiding as conflicts can negatively affect collaboration and decision-making. Let’s illustrate this with an example: coding versus modeling. After spending quite some time on collaborative modeling, there’s often a part of the group that feels it’s time to start coding. There are a lot of reasons why they feel this way: some feel that’s where the real work happens, they feel stuck in their EventStorm, or they just like the coding part better than the modeling part. The other part of the group doesn’t agree with this and wants to continue modeling. They think that continuing will reduce the risk of making costly decisions or mistakes, they want to fine-tune the language further, or they like the collaboration with all the domain experts. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Either way, the group gets torn, and it might turn into conflict. People are trying to convince others of why they are right, coming up with lots of arguments all aimed to get others to their side. They are disagreeing on what to do and wasting valuable energy on this misdiagnosed polarity. Meanwhile, there’s not a lot of progress being made on the EventStorm or coding part. So, very often, the group looks at us as the “experts” and asks us what to do.

We know this isn’t an either/or problem where we pick one of two options. We classify this as a polarity and introduce polarity management to deal with it. Mapping out the polarity at hand together with the group provides insight into the upsides and downsides of both sides, and it helps us recognize when we should move from one side to another. More specifically, it helps us see when we need to move from modeling to coding and the other way around. This is what we mean by managing the polarity. Done properly, the visualization exercise can do the following:

-  Provide a complete picture of both sides.
-  Visualize diversity and encourage you to look at something from different perspectives.
-  Bring people closer together instead of alienating groups that focus on the differences in the perceived conflict.
-  Provide predictability on how to move between the different poles based on shared agreements.

You can visualize a polarity with a polarity map. A *polarity map* (as described in *Polarity Management: Identifying and Managing Unsolvable Problems*, mentioned previously) is a simple visualization tool that will help you manage a polarity, as shown in figure 10.1. In this section, we’ll walk through a polarity map, using the “Deep versus Wide” question we often get when modeling with a group of people.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

![Figure 10.1 Empty polarity map](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F01_Baas.png)

When managing polarities, there are two main things you want to do:

-  Create a shared understanding of the polarity.
-  Visualize how the group will m[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)anage it.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

### 10.2.1 Creating a shared understanding of a polarity

The first thing you need to do when managing a polarity is get a clear picture of the polarity. On the map shown in figure 10.1, we have four quadrants: two on the left (L) to represent one pole, and two on the right (R) to represent the other pole. Each pole has positive and negative effects, which are shown on the map with a plus and minus sign, respectively. If we combine those two, we get four quadrants: L+, L−, R+, and R− (figure 10.2).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

![Figure 10.2 The four quadrants of a polarity map, representing the positive and negative effects of each pole. An alternative way to talk about positive and negative effects of a pole are the upside and downside of that pole.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F02_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)When you’re stuck in a pole for too long, you forget there are benefits to the other pole. When you don’t want to change poles, you can only see the downside that the other pole will bring. With both sides come positive and negative effects, and we want to bring back a shared understanding of the polarity and its effects. That is why we fill in the four quadrants on the polarity map first. In our example of the Deep versus Wide polarity, we placed Deep on the left side, which means the following:

-  L+, the upside of Deep, represents all the positive effects we get from modeling in detail.
-  L−, the downside of Deep, are all the negative effects we get from only modeling in detail.

On the right side, we have Wide:

-  R+, the upside of Wide, represents all the positive effects we get from modeling something end to end.
-  R−, the downside of Wide, are all the negative effects we get from only modeling something end[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) to end.

Placing Deep on the left and Wide on the right was an arbitrary choice, it doesn’t matter which polarity goes on which side. Furthermore, the Upside of Wide is connected to the Downside of Deep, and vice versa because the negative effects of one pole will be part of the positive effects of the other pole. One of the negative effects of modeling something end to end is that you have a lot of questions and assumptions because you’re at a very high level. Modeling in detail will give you answers to the questions and assumptions.

When you fill in the positive and negative sides of each pole, as we did for the EventStorm Deep versus Wide polarity in figure 10.3, you need to think in extremes: What happens if we only model in detail/end [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)to end?[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

A balanced polarity brings us the positive effects of both poles. We called these positive effects Solution-Oriented Modeling, and we called the negative effects Concealed Modeling, as shown in figure 10.3. Giving the positive and negative effects of a name makes it easier to talk about: “We want solution-oriented modeling and want to avoid concealed modeling.” What we mean by this is that we want to experience as much of the positive effects of modeling deep *and* wide, and we want to avoid the negative effects of modeling deep *or* wide for [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)too long.

#### Infinity symbol

In the middle of the four quadrants, there is a big lemniscate, or infinity symbol, touching all the quadrants (refer to figure 10.3). The lemniscate is a remind[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)er of the never-ending balance you need to find when managing a polarity.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

There are actions that you’ll need to take when you start experiencing too much of the downside of one pole. Those actions will move you to the opposite quadrant, the upside of the other pole. We’ll discuss this further in secti[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)on 10.2.2.

![Figure 10.3 The filled-in quadrants of the polarity map. After filling this in, we have a better understanding of the positive and negative effects of the Deep versus Wide polarity.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F03_Baas.png)

#### Filling in the quadrants

You can fill in the four quadrants any way you like, but we want to give you three helpful ways to do this: easiest, minority first, and hardest. The easiest way to fill in the quadrants is very straightforward. You start in the down left quadrant (L−), followed by R−. After that you fill in L+ and R+, respectively. This is shown in figure 10.4. This is the easiest way because it’s a lot easier for people to think of negative effects. The positive effects can then be deducted from the negative ones of the othe[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)r pole.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

As we mentioned in the previous chapter, it’s important to get the minority on board too. If there is a clear division between crusaders and tradition bearers, you can start by examining the viewpoint of the minority. This means that you start with the negative effects of the opposite pole that holds the minority. It sounds confusing, we know, so let’s clarify with an exampl[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)e. In our Deep versus Wide polarity, modeling the domain Deep holds the minority. We put this on the left side of the map. We want to get the minority viewpoint first, so we start with the negative effects that Wide will give us. After that, you just follow the infinity loop again, which would give you R−, L+, R+, L−, as shown in figure[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) 10.5.

![Figure 10.4 If you want to pick the easiest way to fill in the quadrants, start with L− and fill in the negative effects of both poles first with the group.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F04_Baas.png)

![Figure 10.5 The minority first way of filling in the quadrants. In this example, the pole of the minority was placed on the right side of the map, which is why we start with R−.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F05_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)The hardest way to fill in a polarity map is to start with the positive sides of both poles (figure 10.6). The reason this is the hardest way is that it’s a lot easier for people to come up with downsides than it is to come up with upsides of somet[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)hing.

![Figure 10.6 The hardest way to fill in the polarity is to start with the positive effects of both poles.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F06_Baas.png)

Just think about all those job interviews that ask you to sum up three positive and three negative things about yourself. Those negative qualities are always easier to come up with. Yet there are a few benefits to filling in the positive effects first in a polarity map. Often, but not always, there has already been disagreement between the group that wants to stay in one pole and the group that wants to move to the other. When expressing this disagreement, a lot of the negative effects are mentioned. If you want to get people back into a positive mindset, remind them that *both* poles are needed to find a balance, and adding the positive effects will achiev[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)e that.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

### 10.2.2 Managing the polarity

Now that we’ve created a shared understanding of the polarity, it’s time to think about managing it with the group. The goal is to have a set of observations and heuristics that you can use when modeling that will help you decide when it’s time to go from Deep to[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) Wide and vi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ce versa.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

#### Signals

If you get stuck in one pole for too long, the group will start experiencing too many downsides of that pole. People will start exhibiting certain behavior—called observations or signals—because of this experience. They will tell you when it’s time to move to the other pole. These signals are context-dependent: what is observable behavior in one group, won’t be present in another.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Some sources on polarity management will say that signals have to be as specific as possible. For example, a signal would be “Checking your watch three times” instead of “Checking your watch.” We prefer to stay focused on managing the polarity instead of reaching thresholds. If you, as the facilitator, noticed that in the last 2 minutes, 4 people in a group of 10 checked their watches, it might be time to move to the other pole. You could also give a climate report, as we described in chapter 8. It’s very important to stay neutral, as we mentioned in chapter 5, so add no interpretation to the observed behavior. We recommend giving signals a threshold when you start using the polarity map and then slowly move aw[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ay from that.

#### Actions

Now that we know what to look for, it’s time to think about moving between the two poles. To get unstuck, you need to take steps to move to the other pole. These are called actions or heuristics. Signals and actions are connected; an action can be specific for a single signal (one-to-one) or work for many (one-to-many).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

In our Deep versus Wide example (figure 10.7) we identified a few one-to-many actions. You can move away from confused participants by brainstorming what is still missing or modeling anoth[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)er scenario.

##### Exercise 10.1

Fill in the polarity map for the Collaborative Modeling versus Coding polarity. Start with filling in the quadrants for both poles. Then, fill in the signals that you notice in your team, and try to find good actions for[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) every signal.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

## 10.3 Managing polarities during collaborative modeling

Now, let’s delve into how we can adeptly manage polarities during collaborative modeling. To illustrate this concept, we’ll present an example from a value chain mapping session we conducted. *Value chain mapping* is the initial phase of Wardley Mapping, focusing on the vertical axis. Conceived by Simon Wardley, *Wardley Mapping* is a strategic mapping tool that offers organizations a lens to perceive their competitive landscape. By delineating the evolution of components in their value chain, companies can harness actionable insights, guiding them toward sound strategic decisions. You’ll learn more about Wardley Mapping in chapter 12.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

This initial phase of Wardley Mapping that includes Team boundaries, has been referred to as “user needs mapping” by Rich Allen and Matthew Skelton of Team Topologies (“Exploring Team and Service Boundaries with User Needs Mapping,” [https://mng.bz/x2P6](https://mng.bz/x2P6)), emphasizing user needs because that usually is forgotten in organizations. Their approach uses the map to explore team and service boundaries with Team Topologies. Our exploration will take a similar approach to look for a series of interconnected capabilities in our value chain that teams could take ownership of.

This series of interconnected capabilities that a team can take ownership of is what we term a streamlet. A *streamlet* is designed to support a sequence of activities an organization uses to deliver those user needs. Ideally, an engineering team can take ownership of a streamlet, operating and changing it with a high degree of autonomy.

Our emphasis was on the value chain of a user, their needs, and how they interact with our new bounded context design, subsequently integrating it into our existing software architecture. We opted to bypass the horizontal axis of evolution to concentrate on discovering these streamlets and how teams can take ownership on them.

As we share the example from the value chain mapping session, we’ll also guide you on how to conduct such a session. The remainder of Wardley Mapping will be discussed in chapter 12. But before we dive into our BigScreen narrative, let’s reflect on a prior session with another organization where there was a gap in our understanding of polarities. In that specific setting, we came across a frequent polarity in the software industry: the tug-of-war between centralized and decentralized decision-making. So, grab some popcorn; it’s time to delve deep into a pressing topic in the tech world—the emergence of[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) autonomous teams![](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

### 10.3.1 Getting stuck in a polarity

The company that sought our consulting services was in a similar situation to BigScreen’s: grappling with a massive, complicated monolithic application that looked like a big ball of mud (BBoM). Furthermore, four different teams were working on this application simultaneously. The concept of microservices architecture was trending at the time, being hailed as the ideal solution for teams striving for more autonomy in software development. The company requested our guidance to transition from their monolithic system to a microservices architecture.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

To tackle this, we adopted a method similar to what we described in our book. We arranged collaborative modeling sessions that included all developer teams and key stakeholders. While modeling out the current state, we found that the monolith wasn’t completely a BBoM, because it did have some bounded contexts. All the teams had ownership of their own bounded contexts, but those bounded contexts were coupled through what we in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) call a shared kernel pattern. In *Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software* by Eric Evans, a “shared kernel” refers to a specific subset of the domain model with a clearly defined boundary that multiple teams have agreed to share. This kernel should be kept concise. Within this boundary, you should not only include this specific subset of the model, but also the relevant portion of code or the associated database design. Anything within this shared kernel holds special significance and shouldn’t be altered without consulting the other team. This concept becomes crucial when you have separate models that all rely on a shared model, as show[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)n in figure 10.8.

![Figure 10.8 A shared kernel pattern. Four teams each own their own bounded context, but they share a model. Every time that model is affected, they need to talk to the other teams to change it.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F08_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)A shared kernel requires frequent meetings to synchronize changes and ensure that all teams were aligned, which, while necessary, did decrease their autonomy and block there flow of development. In this context, *autonomy* refers to the ability of the teams to make decisions and progress independently without needing constant alignment or approval from others. When one team required the shared model to be changed, all the other teams had to be consulted and potentially needed to change parts of their model as well. That lowers the time to market, as the team is unable to release new features until the other teams have fixed those parts of their model. That additional coordination slows the time to market even more. Additionally, with the application being deployed as a monolith, all programming and library versions were shared. Upgrading these versions can be challenging, as it potentially affects code from another team, which requires more coordination on testing such upgrades. Therefore, the teams were eagerly anticipating the shift toward microservices, hoping for more autonomy, including the ability to manage version upgrades independently.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

We guided them through this transition, ensuring that the teams could keep developing new features while moving the bounded context from the application to a microservices architecture. Over a year, most of the core software components were shifted to this new architecture, thereby reducing the frequency of changes to the shared kernel part of the system. We used a legacy as a service pattern on the shared kernel, which lowered the number of changes to the kernel. The weekly meetings at some point didn’t have any agenda points anymore, so the teams decided to cancel those meetings and let the tech leads align once a change was actually to be made. Because there was a proper API now, changes within the team’s own models would not affect the other teams much.

However, a few months later, we were called in again to address a new problem: most teams were finding it increasingly difficult to implement bigger feature requests on their backlogs. Our investigation revealed that each team now had full control over their own backlog and made their own architectural decisions. However, the increased autonomy led to interdependencies and misalignments between teams, causing delays.

While designing the new feature, Team A stated that their software needed to inform Team B once their users designed and published a new product. Team B had a REST API that could receive this update. However, the call could fail if it included new attributes that the product contained but Team B hadn’t yet configured in their software. This meant Team A had to signal when the REST call failed and then send a Jira request to Team B to configure those attributes before retrying the call. Team A expressed their desire to use an event-driven architecture, which they were already using in their team. They proposed sending a “product is designed” domain event as a message to Team B. Team B can then handle that domain event, and if attributes are missing, fix it straight away. That way, Team A doesn’t need to create Jira tickets anymore. However, Team B wasn’t using an event-driven architecture or any messaging system. They were interested in implementing this, but it wasn’t their priority, which resulted in delays and wasted time on alignment discussions.

The problem was that when we arrived, the organization was focused on a centralized decision-making approach. The pain of that focus on centralized decision-making led them to desire a transition to a more decentralized, autonomous decision-making process. However, at that time, neither we nor the organization were aware of the concept of polarities. As a result, the pendulum swung the other way—to decentralization—but without managing the polarity. Focusing too long on one polarity leads to experiencing the downsides of the other; in this case, the teams were waiting on each other. We initially thought we were resolving a problem related to team autonomy, but, in reality, we were dealing with a polarity. This was a valuable lesson that we learned and applied differ[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ently with BigScreen.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

### 10.3.2 Managing a polarity as facilitator

From our experience, conflicts arise when both/and polarities are being treated like either/or problems. Start coding or continue to model? People can try to convince each other why they are right, and it should be one of the two sides. When you observe this as a facilitator, this is your cue to address and manage the polarity. We do this by making the polarity explicit first. For example, we use a sensemaking exercise by putting both polarities at opposite ends of a line and asking people where they stand. Or we give a climate report. Then, once the group collectively recognizes the polarity, we suggest to collectively fill in a polarity map to manage it properly, or we’ll let the group decide to let us manage the polarity for them during that session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

During our value chain mapping at BigScreen, we noticed the Deep versus Wide polarity affecting the group, something that we had observed in earlier sessions. As facilitators, one is always weighing the decision: Should you intervene by subtly guiding the group, or should you enable them to navigate the polarity on their own? Each situation calls for its own unique approach. Giving the group the wisdom to handle the polarity is a gradual process. Initially, we tried to handle the polarity within the group, mirroring our approach from prior sessions.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Use the polarity that the group is affected by as polarized questions in your check-in or sensemaking.

After clarifying the outcome and reviewing the agenda, we prompted the group to outline the user journey for the “Anytime, Anywhere” campaign. This journey begins with the planning and scheduling of a movie screening and culminates with attendees receiving their tickets. Typically, our starting point in a value chain is the user and their core needs. While the core needs of a movie visitor are that they get a good seat and enjoy the movie, the act of paying for tickets and selecting seats isn’t their primary need. However, given that the user journey had already been designed and guided by these core needs, we chose to leave them out of this specific value chain mapping and only model out the activity in the user journey.

By making this autocratic decision as facilitators, the first signs of the Deep versus Wide polarity began to emerge. There was a discussion among the participants about whether we needed to delve further into the core needs of the users on the map. We had clearly outlined that the goal was to find streamlets that teams could take ownership of, but some individuals wanted to delve deeper into the user’s needs. This posed a challenge to our neutrality: on the one hand, we wanted the group to decide on the direction; on the other hand, as consultants, we had our own stake in[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) coming up with a design.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

#### Using proposals to move the group forward

The first thing we did was revert to our role fluidity skills as mentioned in chapter 9 and question why we needed to delve deeper into the user needs. Why would it be necessary? The response was that the group wanted to verify whether UX had made the correct assumptions when designing the user journey. Some individuals, who weren’t part of the initial decisions, found it challenging to grasp the details and see their connection to the user’s needs. So, we asked who could somewhat relate to not seeing the connection. Some developers raised their hands. However, when we asked who sees it differently, quite a few people didn’t see the value of delving deeper. They believed that it would overemphasize user research and cause us to lose time exploring the connections between the systems.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Make a proposal autocratic decision for the team to manage a polarity when the polarity is affecting the goal of the session. You should connect all the needs in the proposal.

In this instance, we noticed that most people in the group aligned with the session’s goal. Thus, we made a proposal to the group, explaining that we would continue and, after finishing this session, we could delve deeper into the user’s needs or plan a follow-up session to do so. We asked if anyone had serious objections to this proposal, and what they need to go along. No one responded, and everyone seemed fine with the decision, allowing us to proceed and eventually ending up with what is shown in figure 10.9. We were prepared that the polarity of going deep into the user’s needs versus going wide and finishing the map would arise. By employing role fluidity and using a proposal for decision-making, we could guide the group toward the goal, placing the responsibility of the session in their hands.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

![Figure 10.9 The first step of mapping the landscape is a value chain. In this case, we didn’t map the actual user needs, but kept it to the activities models as needs that were already designed to solve those actual needs in a user journey.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F09_Baas.png)

Note that we were fairly confident that the majority of the group wanted to proceed with the session and go wide, instead of going deep. We also clearly established the workshop’s goal. We observed the downside behavior that happens when we stay in the Deep polarity, and we included a solution in our decision for those who wanted to go deeper on user research. Only by incorporating all of these aspects into our proposal could we make that autocratic decision without sacrificing neutrality. Unfortunately, [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)this isn’t always the case.

#### Using climate reports to let the group deal with a polarity

After clarifying the users and the user journey, we adopted the Small Group Diverge and Converge collaboration style, which we mentioned in chapter 4. We formed groups of four to five participants, who then collectively mapped out the value chain for approximately 40 minutes. It’s difficult to use a group of more than seven people for a value chain because the modeling space is limited. In addition, individuals who perceive themselves as lower-ranking often become silent and passive in larger groups. Therefore, our preference is for smaller groups, even though managing multiple groups can be challenging.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

We tasked the groups with initially finishing the value chain by adding all the components of the software architecture that solves the user needs. In Wardley Mapping, these are known as *capabilities*, but because we solely focus on the software architecture, we rephrased them specifically for this session to *components* of the system. We closely observed the groups for any signs of drawbacks associated with a wide approach. Some of them started to debate after completing the map and going into greater detail. They began making assumptions due to unknown details in the current systems about the logic that is happening in the Movies component. Figure 10.10 sho[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ws[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) what they were discussing.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

![Figure 10.10 The completed map is very simple, only showing a few components in the back office and backend. A lot of connections go to the movies part of the backend, and some believe they should further deep dive to better understand what is happening there.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F10_Baas.png)

The discussion revolved around how the back-office components Movies Pages, Movie Screening Page, and Seat Picker connected with the Movies component. Some group participants felt it was essential to understand these details as they believed it was critical to delve deep to be able to design toward a solution and visualize ambiguity. Others in the group didn’t want to get overly detailed at this stage but preferred to stay wide and focus on the components in the current system to understand the whole system first.

At this point, we observed both deep and wide positive and negative effects emerging in the conversation. You can also recognize these effects from figure 10.6 earlier in this chapter. Previously, we had made a decision to keep the scope wide and avoid delving into user needs. Yet now, as polarities are, we often find ourselves confronted by both sides once again. Despite not fully developing the software architecture in line with user needs, we’re unable to prescribe the best approach for the group. We couldn’t facilitate decision-making to address their concerns, as they would likely face the same challenges in subsequent stages of the project. Our primary role was to pinpoint the existing polarity and devise strategies to help them navigate it.

About 25 minutes into the breakout session, we asked for the group’s attention and provided a climate report (as explained in chapter 8). We informed them that all groups had completed the map, and some groups were now debating the level of detail necessary for the modeling. These discussions were preventing them from progressing on the map. We saw people acknowledging by nodding, so we told the group “I notice some members of the group nodding their heads”. One person began to speak but was immediately interrupted by someone else, which is typical when dealing with a polarity.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Use a climate report to make the group aware that they are dealing with a polarity.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)After letting the discussion go on for a few minutes, it was time for another climate report: “We observed a lot of back and forth conversation with frequent interruptions.” The group became silent, and we allowed a pause for a minute. Someone then mentioned the frequent debates on how wide and deep they should go and how it often resulted in a heated discussion, impeding their progress. We proposed a short intermezzo to the session to collectively explore the deep vs width polarity, hoping it would help us move forward in the session. The gr[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)oup agreed, and we initiated a *conversation on four fee*t from the Lewis Deep Democracy method ([www.lewisdeepdemocracy.com](https://www.lewisdeepdemocracy.com)). Let’s dive into what a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) conversation on four feet is.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

#### Visualizing the polarity with a conversation on four feet

A conversation on four feet is a useful exercise when groups get stuck in a polarity but aren’t fully aware of it, or they can’t quite grasp what the polarity is exactly. Our goal was to let the group explore and reflect on both sides and make the polarity evident. Many polarized groups tend to *listen to react* to get their point across instead of *listening to understand* the other person. They often focus more on arguing rather than having a dialogue. If this continues unchecked, decisions made will be heavily influenced by whichever polarity holds a majority in the group. This can lead to a binary either/or outcome. We aim for a both/and situation, so we need participants to understand both sides.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Use the conversation on four feet method to nudge people into listening to understand as opposed to listening to react.

In the conversation on four feet, enabling constraints are placed to ensure groups listen to understand. The setup involves a group standing with enough space to move around. It begins with someone presenting a statement to the group, followed by the facilitator standing next to that person and using active listening to clarify the statement if necessary. The facilitator then instructs the rest of the group to either stand behind the person if they agree with the statement or to find a place opposite that person if they disagree. The facilitator then approaches someone opposite the statement and asks them to speak up. Figure 10.11 gives a visual[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/) representation of the process.

By using the enabling constraint of not being able to reply directly, people need to first understand what has been said and then take a position in the group. It’s important to state up front that if anyone doesn’t want to speak up or take the spotlight, they can always move with the majority of the group, so we can make it safe for people who don't want to take a stand. As a facilitator, it’s beneficial to keep a close watch on those who choose to do so, and perhaps converse with them privately after the session to understand their needs. Typically, the conversation lasts around 10–15 minutes before the group divides into two larger groups, and statements start to cycle back and forth. At this point, as a facilitator, you should halt the conversation and ask the g[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)roup to share their observations.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

![Figure 10.11 Conversation on four feet starts with Step 1, in which one participant gives out a statement. Then, the group moves to Step 2, where either they agree and stand with the person giving the statement, or they disagree. At that point, the facilitator turns to someone disagreeing to give another statement. Eventually, you can see the group polarize.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F11_Baas.png)

##### Role mapping

Role mapping is another technique within the Lewis Deep Democracy method that also can be seen as a collaborative modeling tool by identifying the various roles within a given session. The initial step is to engage the group in brainstorming to uncover all the relevant roles; this, however, does require the group to have a basic understanding of what a role is. This understanding is crucial, as visualizing these roles not only aids in identification but also fosters a sense of fluidity and adaptability among participants.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

Once identified, the group progresses to categorizing these roles, focusing on their interactions and how they align or contrast with each other. This step is instrumental in highlighting the underlying tensions and identifying the dominant polarity facing the group. By categorizing roles in this manner, the group gains insights into the dynamics at play and can effectively group and categorize these in polarities. The map then clarifies the dominant polarity they are dealing with, so the team can use it as input on a polarity map.

After the observations were shared, we presented the group with two choices:

-  *Polarity mapping*—We could guide them in managing this polarity through polarity mapping. This approach might divert our focus from the primary session’s objectives, possibly requiring an additional session to accomplish our initial goals.
-  *Facilitator-led polarity management*—Alternatively, we could consolidate the group’s inputs into a single value chain map. As facilitators, we would manage the polarity and determine when to explore certain topics in-depth and when to adopt a broader perspective.

We asked if it was okay to put this to a vote, and no one in the group seemed to disagree. The vote ended with a majority favoring the merging of maps and letting us decide when to delve deeply and when to broaden the scope. For the minority, we added two things to the decision: to organize a polarity mapping session in the future, and to mark the parts that people wanted to delve into so that we could decide at the end of the session what to do with those areas. Everyone agreed, and so we continued the session.

![Figure 10.12 The simplified value chain map of the current situation. The text bubbles are hotspots where we can deep dive deeper if needed. Vertically rounded boxes that group together needs and components represent possible streamlets that can help split up the teams.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH10_F12_Baas.png)

We could now continue the session and finish the value chain map. You can see a simplified version in figure 10.12. The group gave us the authority to decide when to move on and when not to. We still needed to be careful not to lose that rank and avoid making a decision that would create too much resistance. Therefore, using the hotspots and continually observing the group behavior remained important. Even though the session ended the way we needed it to, we’re not yet beyond that polarity. As we, the facilitators, are managing the polarity, the group is now dependent on us. As a result, any design session the group is doing will be affected by this polarity, and being dependent on the facilitator can serve as a bottleneck. I mean, even facilitators need to go on vacation sometimes. So, it’s important before going to a check-out to address how we’ll go forward with managing the polarity. Because we’re responsible for managing that polarity, it’s important to do a polarity mappin[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)g session with the participants.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

### 10.3.3 Letting the group manage the polarity

We’ve already discussed in this chapter how we can use a polarity map to visualize a polarity. A polarity mapping session is also a collaborative modeling session, where we model how we want to manage the polarity. You can approach this session similarly to any other discussed in this book and use the six stages mentioned in chapter 4 to prepare for that session. You can incorporate the polarity in your check-in, during which we typically ask the group what happens when people delve too deep or spread too wide, and what they do to avoid it. This check-in can nudge the group to contemplate signals and actions for later on in the session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

In the case of BigScreen, we chose to divide the group into smaller groups, each having people from both polarities equally represented. During the conversation on 4 feet, we sensed that both sides were equally represented, so we initiated the session by asking each group to list all positive aspects of diving deep and spreading wide for about 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, we asked them to switch to the negatives. Then, we asked them to silently walk around and observe the other maps, and then return to their groups to further discuss any differences they saw in other groups. We also prompted them to think about their greatest fear of not managing the polarity and what they would like to achieve when managing it.

With a comprehensive overview of the polarity per group, we invited the group to take a break before delving into the signals/observations and actions/heuristics part of the map. While the first part of mapping the polarity doesn’t require a lot of facilitation, the second part typically does. Some groups excel at describing the observations/signals, but others find it challenging. When groups get stuck, we often suggest that they first contemplate what situations would make them feel affected by the polarity. In the case of BigScreen, they noticed that it always occurs when software architecture decisions need to be made. Having that in mind, we ask them what they observe happening. You can see that outcome in the map we presented earlier in figure 10.7.

As stated previously in section 10.2, it’s essential that our observations are concrete. For instance, confusion was identified as an observation in the figure. But how do we pinpoint this? What tangible behaviors or verbal cues indicate confusion? Maybe we observe no movement of people or stickies on the board, individuals asking a multitude of clarifying questions, or nonverbal cues such as frowning.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)To ensure everyone is on the same page about when an observation such as confusion is taking place, it’s imperative we establish clear criteria. In collaboration with the group, we’ve agreed that every time we assume there might be confusion to conduct a sensemaking exercise. If more than three people in the group express feeling confused, it signals that we need to take action. Crucially, these observational criteria and the subsequent actions must be accepted by the group. This collective agreement ensures that polarity is effectively managed by everyone involved.

Now that the observations and actions are accepted by the group, the group can start managing the polarity. Every time the group actively observes the signals discussed, they now know how to act based on the map. Over time, it will become the norm, and people will start to unconsciously show the behavior based on the signals without actively needing to observe the signals. Over time, the group will eventually encounter another polarity that will require active management, and that’s why a polarity can’t [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)be solved but always needs to be managed.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

## 10.4 Collaborative software design catalysts

-  Write down some polarities you’re observing or struggling with in your own context. Specify why these are polarities that need to be managed instead of problems that need to be solved. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)
-  Identify one or two polarities that are significantly affecting (or hindering) you and the people you’re working with. Bring them to the group as sensemaking or climate report to validate and discuss, and suggest visualizing the polarities.
-  Find a moment to visualize the polarity together with the group. Use the polarity map from this chapter, including actions and signa[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)ls. Discuss insights and outcomes afterward.

## 10.5 Chapter heuristics

*Guiding heuristics*[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)

-  When you encounter a difficult dilemma, ask yourself whether this a problem we need to solve or a polarity that we need to manage.
-  When you, as a facilitator, spot a polarity, validate it with the group, and then ask the group, “Would it add value to dive into this polarity right now (by visualizing it)?”
-  Use the polarity that the group is affected by as polarized questions in your check-in or sensemaking.
-  Make a proposal autocratic decision for the team to manage a polarity when the polarity is affecting the goal of the session. You should connect all the needs in the proposal.
-  Use a climate report to make the group aware that they are dealing with a polarity.
-  Use the conversation on four feet method to nudge people into listening to understand as opposed to listening to react.

## Summary

-  Polarities represent ongoing problems or challenges that can’t be resolved by picking one side over the other; they are interdependent pairs that need to be managed over time to maximize the benefits of both sides.
-  Proper polarity management can improve group collaboration and decision-making by providing insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each side, visualizing diversity, encouraging various perspectives, bringing people together, and creating predictability on transitioning between different poles based on shared agreements.
-  As a facilitator, it’s crucial to recognize potential polarities within a group or individual, validate them, and then allow the group to decide whether to address them.
-  A polarity map is a visualization tool for managing polarities; it helps create a shared understanding of a polarity’s positive and negative effects, encouraging thinking in extremes, balancing between poles, and facilitating easier communication about effects.
-  When completing a polarity map, starting with the negative effects can often be easier due to human bias toward identifying downsides, and sometimes it’s important to involve the minority viewpoint first to ensure all perspectives are accounted for.
-  Managing a polarity involves recognizing context-dependent signals indicative of an imbalance and then taking appropriate actions or heuristics to move toward the other pole. Practicing this with a polarity map aids in identifying these signals and determining effective actions, ultimately ensuring a balanced approach to the polar problems at hand.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-10/)
