### This chapter covers

- Implicit and explicit ranking
- Symbolic violence and how it affects collaborative modeling
- How ranking affects the design and architecture
- Influencing ranking as a facilitator

In the previous chapter we talked about facilitating a collaborative modeling session. We also spoke about the responsibilities and the skills a facilitator requires, and how those help you facilitate. In this chapter, we’ll dive into the meaning and function of ranking in collaborative modeling sessions. When we’re talking about *ranking*, we mean a relative position in a social hierarchy. Social hierarchies come in many different forms, including collaborative modeling sessions. Where we position ourselves in a social hierarchy compared to others shapes how we think and behave. This means ranking is subjective. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Ever been in a situation where you felt like everyone else was much more knowledgeable than you, had much more experience than you, and had a more valuable perspective than yours? If you did, you’ve experienced ranking firsthand. You might have been impressed by that situation and thought twice before speaking your mind. Or maybe you waited for others to speak first before you gave your opinion. In collaborative modeling sessions, we observe some people speaking up easily, where others stay quiet and refrain from the group a bit. We observe some people taking the lead and making decisions, while others are waiting to see what will happen. All of these behaviors might have to do with ranking, and this affects the way we design software. So, it’s essential as a facilitator to know the influence that ranking has on a collaborative modeling session and how you can help the group get unstuck from ranking hierarchies that constrain discovery[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/).

## 6.1 Ranking explained

Ranking is highly related to power gradients, which might be a more familiar or recognizable concept in the organizational context. Your position in a social hierarchy is influencing decisions, behavior, and thoughts. We all have experienced situations like the one described earlier. Maybe you found yourself in an opposite situation as well: you were the most knowledgeable, experienced, and/or powerful person in the room, which meant a higher ranking in that social hierarchy. How we perceive ranking in a social hierarchy and whether it’s hindering or helping us, depends on our personal rank in different situations (social hierarchies). In this section, we’ll dive into ranking and what it means, why it’s not a bad thing, and how it helps us in groups. We’ll also talk about symbolic violence and the difference between explicit and implicit ranking.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.1.1 What is ranking?

To explain what ranking is, we’ll go into a little bit of theory and then give some practical examples. Ranking is something that can be observed in collaborative modeling sessions because it has a lot to do with social hierarchies and power gradients within a group. Understanding how this works in collaborative modeling and how it may affect outcomes can help you in facilitating session[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)s.

#### Social rank theory explained

Ranking is a relative position in a social hierarchy. As mentioned in the introduction, where we position ourselves in social hierarchy often shapes our thinking and behavior. This is also what makes ranking subjective and context-dependent. If we position ourselves in a higher rank, we’ll probably show different behavior than when we position ourselves in a lower rank. Ranking is related to research that focuses on social classes. The social classes they refer to are working class and middle class. In “Social Class as Culture,” the authors described that for working-class individuals, the “self” tends to be more tied to others, and there is an emphasis on strong social bonds. In contrast, middle-class individuals tend to define themselves as separate from others and are more focused on their own uniqueness.[1](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/footnote-005)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) These identities are being taught to children from a young age, and it influences thinking and behavior. This means that social classes also affect how we perceive our own abilities. People from higher social classes tend to have more favorable views of themselves compared to people from relatively low social classes. They might show higher self-esteem that may even lean toward overconfidence.[2](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/footnote-004)

In *Sitting in the Fire,*[3](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/footnote-003) Arnold Mindell provides tangible guidance on ranking in groups and how to deal with it. According to Mindell, a *rank* is a conscious or unconscious social or personal ability or power arising from culture, community support, personal psychology, and/or spiritual power. In other words, a person’s rank is the sum of their privileges. Within the context of collaborative modeling, it’s important to know that ranking has to do with (in)formal power and how we position ourselves compared to others in the group. Ranks can differ per social hierarchy (group). It lives mostly in people’s shadows and can heavily affect the flow of a session. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

In short, we’re conditioned by society and the social hierarchies we live in to position ourselves and everyone around us in a certain rank. To be clear, this isn’t a bad thing. Doing this helps us make sense of the world and all the information that we need to process. It helps us to make sense of the group we’re in and position ourselves and others quickly. That, in turn, will help us determine how to behave in a certain situation. Note that (luckily) we’re not doing this consciously most of the time. Because we have experience and are conditioned, we’re able to do this quickly, which helps us to move on fast.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### Ranking in practice

Imagine you’d have to do this positioning consciously every time you enter a group—there wouldn’t be any time left to do collaborative modeling, that’s for sure. So, this ranking phenomenon actually helps us—most of the time. It can also hinder flow during a session or prevent the group from adding the full wisdom and potential. As a facilitator, ranking is something you need to be aware of. You need to be able to observe it in a group and make it explicit if desired or necessary. In section 6.3, we’ll dive more into how to facilitate ranking. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Now that we know some more about some of the scientific theory behind ranking, we want to explain how it works in practice. More specifically, we need to know how it affects collaborative modeling sessions. In a lot of those sessions, you see certain behavior that occurs regularly and might have something to do with ranking. For example, some people stay very quiet and take quite a long time to take part in a conversation. Some people are hesitant to share their opinion or formulate it in a question. Some people are very comfortable taking the lead and impose solutions and decisions on the group. Subgroups that emerge when working on the timeline or people standing in front of the group or more to the back are behaviors that might seem meaningless, but very often they have something to do with where people position themselves in comparison to the rest of the group, that is, how they rank themselves within a group and adjust their behavior to that rank.

Becoming conscious of ranking gives you a choice on how to use it, feel it, or be aware of it in different instances. This is where it gets even more interesting. When overusing your rank, you create a sense of power and control over others. In some situations, this can be useful. In most collaborative modeling sessions, it can prevent the entire wisdom of the group from being added to the outcome. For example, you derive a sense of power from being a CTO, which means your ideas, solutions, and suggestions can become more important and valuable to others in the room. This may cause them to conform with the CTO’s ideas and thereby not share other perspectives. That’s not necessarily what you want to achieve in a collaborative modeling session where you’re focusing on gaining all perspectives and wisdom from a group. In a different situation, where the CTO needs to make a decision on their own and where only their opinion is decisive, they can actually benefit from their rank. Not everything needs to be a democratic decision—thankfully. In chapter 9, we’ll go into various decision-making styles and their advantages.

This does mean that the people higher in rank should be aware of this and adjust their behavior to this knowledge. For example, when they want to include the wisdom of the group, they postpone giving their opinions, it is better to avoid taking the spotlight, and they do ask questions instead of providing solutions. In section 6.3, we’ll explain why it’s important to own, play, and share your rank within a group.

As mentioned earlier, a facilitator plays a big role here. Ranking can be a sensitive subject when it’s made explicit and can cause uncomfortableness within a group. In the context of collaborative modeling sessions, facilitators tend to be relatively high in rank given their experience and role within the group, and that comes with a responsibility in terms of facilitating ra[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)nking.

#### What does ranking look like?

Let’s illustrate ranking in practice with an example from one of the collaborative modeling sessions we facilitated. One of the greatest things about collaborative modeling (at least we think so), is that when it is facilitated correctly, it’s so inclusive. We need all relevant stakeholders and their perspectives and knowledge. That also means there’s a lot of potential difference in ranking. This was the case for this particular session. Participants ranged from CTOs to middle management to product owner to developer to marketing and HR, so there was lots of wisdom in the group. While ranking can affect the group, it can also affect facilitation. We, the facilitators, were one woman with a light technical background but heavy background in social sciences, and one man with a heavy technical background and more years of experience. As facilitators, we absolutely love this balance because we complement each other. At one point, we found ourselves in a conversation with one of the male participants about pivotal events. Following is a part of that conversation:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Male participant: So, *<Male Facilitator>*, I’m not sure if I fully grasp the concept of pivotal events. Could you explain again what exactly classifies as a pivotal event?

Male facilitator: Sure, let’s go over that again. As *<Female Facilitator>* just explained, a pivotal event is a key event to start sorting and structuring the domain events. These are events that are very important to the group and mark a key point in the flow: only when this happens, other events can happen.

Female facilitator: And the reason we introduce them here is to start structuring the timeline. We can place stickies to the left or right of those pivotal events. In that way, we can split the group and merge after a while.

Male participant: Ah, yes, I see. So *<Male Facilitator>*, can they appear anywhere in this timeline? If we need to structure the timeline, we might need some direction.

Male facilitator: Correct. As *<Female Facilitator>* just explained, we use this to split up the group so we can speed up.

Male participant: Right, and what would you, *<Male Facilitator>* pick as a pivotal event in this timeline?

Male facilitator: That’s up to the group. But *<Female Facilitator>* did provide some suggestions to the group when she was explaining the concept of pivotal events. I suggest *<Female Facilitator>* goes over them again.

Male participant: I don’t fully recall which suggestions were made. Maybe you can go over them again.

Female facilitator: [Stunned.]

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)This example is a perfect illustration of how ranking works. It’s pretty clear how the male participant positions the facilitators and himself in this social hierarchy. Note that there is no judgment here. This is a consequence of how we’re conditioned and that affects our behavior. There were absolutely no bad intentions or deliberate ignorance at play here. In this social hierarchy, the male facilitator was placed in a higher rank because of how we’re conditioned. Being a man, having experience, and having a technical background suggests a higher rank in this context. Based on that, the male participant asked his questions to the male facilitator. In section 6.1.2, we’ll dive further into characteristics that determine ranking.

What helped in this situation was the male facilitator being very much aware of ranking and what it can do, and anticipating that. By saying things such as “as *<Female Facilitator>* explained” and “I suggest *<Female Facilitator>* goes over them again,” the male facilitator made sure the rank of the female facilitator remained high. He could have done the opposite by taking all the questions and credit, thereby overruling the female facilitator. By not doing that, he tried to keep their ranking equal.

(Fast forward: later in this collaborative session, the concept of ranking was explained to this group. The male participant wasn’t aware of the concept and how it affected his thinking and behavior. Reflecting on the example above with the group made the concept of ranking tangible and explicit. No feelings were hurt in this e[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)xample.)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### Exercise 6.1

Think about your own experience: When did you encounter a situation where you felt hindered or empowered by your personal rank? How did it affect your own behavior? Write down your thoughts, and, if you like, discuss it with others to share experiences and persp[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ectives.

### 6.1.2 Implicit versus explicit ranking

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)When talking about ranking, we make a distinction between explicit ranking and implicit ranking. *Explicit ranking* refers to the relative powers that come with a specific position someone has in a certain situation, for example, your position in the organizational chart, your formal level of power, your job title, and so on. These are things that are related to formal levels of power that were developed within a social hierarchy. *Implicit ranking* refers to relative powers that are usually unearned and are supported by social norms. It’s about things such as gender, skin color, age, ethnicity, nationality, education, knowledge, experience, and so on. Implicit ranking is also about relative powers beyond the formal power structures; for example, implicit leaders are people who have a natural form of charisma and people want to follow them, despite their position in the organizational chart.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Ranking isn’t a fixed concept. It depends heavily on the context and social hierarchy you’re in, which makes it subjective. Implicit ranking is a more sensitive subject and harder to observe and interpret. It also greatly depends on the social context (group) you’re part of whether you score high or low on these items. In a board meeting with only men of 50+ years of age, a 32-year-old woman might be the lowest in rank, but that same 32-year-old woman could be highest in rank in the context of a training on facilitation where she is the trainer. Ranking is heavily dependent on the social context we’re in. This also makes it hard to be constantly aware of our own rank and anticipate it. During our workshops and training, we sometimes use an exercise to assess the ranking within a group.

We did the same exercise with BigScreen. Because ranking can be a delicate subject, we always take time to do this and start with explaining to the group what ranking is and how it can affect a group. Especially within the context of collaborative modeling, we discuss how ranking can affect behavior and what you can observe. We share some of our own experiences with ranking and open up to the group, inviting them to share their own experiences if they want to.

The conversation described in section 6.1.1 is an example of what we would share with a group when it comes to our experiences. After that, we want to make the ranking within the group explicit by using a ranking assessment tool. Figure 6.1 shows the questions we use to make ranking explicit. On the right, there are a couple of questions related to both explicit and implicit ranking. We ask people to score themselves individually on these questions in the following way: How do you position yourself compared to others in that specific group? If you feel you score lower on a certain question than others in the group, you get 1 point; if you feel neutral, you get 2 points; and if you feel you score higher than others in the group, you get 3 points. All of these points add up to a total number. Those are represented in the stickies in figure 6.1. This is subjective and can differ per the group you’re a part of, which is also what makes it delicate and sometimes se[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)nsitive.

![Figure 6.1 Outcome of a ranking sensemaking exercise at BigScreen. The assessment is from Mindell (Source: Jam Cultures by Jitske Kramer [Management Impact, 2021]). It guides individuals to score themselves on factors such as heritage, gender, health, and education. Participants rank themselves relative to their peers and place their total score on a scale. From here, we can create subgroups from both sides of the scale and better understand the effect ranking has on the group.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH06_F01_Baas.png)

The next step is discussing these outcomes—not with us as facilitators, but within the group. What we usually do is pair up the highest number, the lowest number, and someone from the middle. We ask the duo to talk about their scores and how they got there by looking at differences and similarities, and sharing some personal experiences around ranking. When were you hindered by your rank? When did you benefit from it? Are there any situations that, in hindsight, were affected by your rank or the rank of others? We always ask afterward if someone would like to share something, but we never push people. We do this exercise to let the group become more aware of their ranking and how it affects the group. In our experience, very valuable conversations take place in this part of a session.

Understanding the nature of ranking, along with the distinctions between explicit and implicit ranking, can enhance awareness of group dynamics. Before we explain how to become aware of ranking, we need to first discuss two critical concepts closely intertwined with ranking theory—symbolic violence and epistemic injustice—that significantly influence collaborative software desi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)gn efforts.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.1.3 Symbolic violence

*Symbolic violence* describes how behavior is affected in situations or groups where there is a power differential. It’s about a type of nonphysical violence that is a result of ranking and power dynamics. To understand this concept, we have to dive into sociology for a bit, and more specifically, into the work of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu on symbolic violence. Symbolic violence is strongly related to what we described earlier in this chapter about ranking and social hierarchies. Bourdieu uses the concept of symbolic violence to explain how social hierarchies and inequalities are maintained less by physical force than by forms of symbolic domination. Next, we’ll dive into the symbolic and violence part of this concept to understand how it affects collaborative modeling. For the record, no physical violence is involv[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ed whatsoever.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### Symbolic power

Symbolic violence has to do with *symbolic power*. Bourdieu defines symbolic power as power based on recognition: “renown, prestige, honor, glory, authority.”[4](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/footnote-002) Although this concept might sound vague, everyone has an idea of what this symbolic power looks like. To illustrate: when we see two people standing next to each other, we can usually tell who has more power. That is because we’re all conditioned to recognize characteristics (or symbols) of power when we see someone. We often associate power with physical power, but symbolic power is more than that—it’s about understanding power in broader terms. Think about the clothes someone is wearing, the car they’re driving, their gender, their age, their job title, the music they listen to, the food they eat, and the sports they practice. There’s an infinite list of traits (symbols) that tell us something about the relative amount of power someone has. It’s important to note again that this is subjective. The amount of power we describe to someone depends on the situation, culture, and the person ascribing the power. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Note the relation between the symbols of power and implicit and explicit ranking. Symbols such as a job title are related to explicit ranking, where gender, ethnicity, and age are more related to implicit ranking. Symbolic power is about all of these traits. Again, this is a subjective concept. You might yield more power to someone based on symbols of violence, but that doesn’t mean that person actually has more power.

Based on those symbols, we all develop a symbolic ideal—or mental image—of what we see as dominant/strong and dominated/weak. This symbolic ideal changes over time and differs per social hierarchy and culture. It’s very context dependent. For example, there was a time when being overweight was a sign of wealth and power. This symbolic ideal changed over time for certain cultures. New norms and social and cultural ideals also change the symbolic ideals of people. The more traits (symbols of power) someone possesses from that list within a specific context, the more symbolic power we’ll yield to them. Based on this, we’ll establish social structures and levels of power in a group. According to Bourdieu, we accept and internalize these power structures and hierarchies in a social group into our mental structures (*habitus*, as Bourdieau calls it). In other words, we very often unconsciously accept a social hierarchy based on th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)is symbolic power. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### Examples of symbolic power

Let’s clarify symbolic power with an example. For quite some time, it was (or in some industries it is) culturally accepted that boardrooms were dominated by men. This follows the theory on symbolic power, which goes way back in this case. For a long time, it was socially accepted that men were the better gender to do this kind of work. Women were lower in rank when it came to the context of boardrooms. Men possessed more traits of that list and thereby more symbolic power than women. Think about the level of education, gender, working experience, social position in society, accessories worn, and so on. So, in that sense, it made sense that boardrooms were dominated by men. Society accepted that. Things have changed over the past few years. Organizations actively steer toward adjusting the symbolic ideal and yielding more symbolic power to women when it comes to boardroom positions. The reason this has been so hard has to do with the way we’re conditioned with that symbolic ideal. It takes time to change that within a society. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Here’s another example: within a collaborative modeling session, there is symbolic power flying around as well. It’s often part of the shadows of people, but people can sense it in a way. A CTO usually has more symbolic power than a developer. That might mean that the group is more likely to accept suggestions and solutions from the CTO than from a developer. In most collaborative modeling sessions, this power structure is accepted and internalized, and it takes active effort to counter the power structure when desired. The CTO needs to be aware of their symbolic power and rank and adjust their behavior to what they want to achieve with that session. If they want to achieve completeness, which means everyone needs to add their wisdom to the group, it might be effective for the CTO not to talk first all the time, not to talk in terms of solutions, and to ask questions more often and provide answers less. The symbolic ideal and power are always there, but we can choose how we act upon it. As facilitators, it’s very important to be able to observe and anticipate this symbolic power.

For Bourdieu, this all means that every individual is constantly classifying themselves and others as alike or different. Based on the symbols of power, we symbolize social similarity and social difference from one another, which helps us define power structures.[5](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/footnote-001) In other words, we’re continuously making sense of these symbols that are flying around when we’re in social hierarchy, and we use those symbols to determine the position of ourselves and others. When doing collaborative modeling, it’s useful to be aware of this because it will determine how people behave in terms of who will act more dominant and who will act more submissive. Note that there is nothing wrong with this concept and its effects on groups and collaborative modeling. It’s how we’re wired as societies and how we make sense of the world around us. All we’re saying is that it helps to understand these concepts, symbols of power, and dynamics to be better able [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)to facilitate groups.

#### The violence in symbolic violence

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)So where does the violence come in, you might ask. The good news is that there is no physical violence involved in this theory. The point here is that symbolic violence is something we do to ourselves. Following Bourdieu’s theory, we could state that when you’re in a room with someone that has more symbolic power than you, you’re basically conditioned to be more submissive to that person—to a certain extent, of course. Because we very often (unconsciously) internalize power structures, we show certain behavior that makes sense within that context and power structure. If we feel we have less power than others, we’re more likely to follow suggestions of the more powerful, we’re more hesitant to challenge their input, and we let them speak first, for example. When we have more symbolic power than others, we (unconsciously) might speak more, interrupt others easier, suggest solutions, and provide answers, for example. That’s the violence part. We can suffer from these internalized power structures, experiencing violence. We can also exert this violence by using it to our advantage when we have more symbolic power. Violence can go both ways, and in both ways, the amount of symbolic power determines our behavior. By doing this, we create and maintain a certain hierarchy or power structure. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

According to Bourdieu (as described earlier in this section), we absorb the structures and hierarchies of the social settings in which we exist into our mental structures, almost becoming part of our subconscious mind. The power structures and the submissiveness or dominance become more or less natural and so does our behavior in these social settings. Again, this symbolic violence is something we do to ourselves. We’re conditioned to have these symbolic ideals, and we rank ourselves given the information at hand. We decide for ourselves whether we have more or less symbolic power than others. Remember the ranking assessment tool we described in section 6.1.2? We score ourselves on these items. It’s not a rational scale where everyone would get to the same number for each person.

Although the structures and hierarchies that became part of our mental structures are often unconscious and not explicit, we can feel the effects of symbolic violence. In black and white terms, there is someone suffering from symbolic violence, and there is someone benefiting from it. The person who is “suffering” from symbolic violence takes the lesser part of the deal here. Being lower in rank might cause you to feel inferior. Imposter syndrome will be very present, so you might feel like you should educate yourself more before you give your opinion or maybe you feel like people might not take you seriously. All of this could result in more submissive behavior. The person benefiting from this symbolic violence—the one with the most symbolic power—very often isn’t aware of this violence taking place. This person will be higher in rank than the other person(s), and there are lots of benefits related to that: they will probably not get interrupted, people will listen to them and accept their suggestions and solutions more easily, they won’t be challenged a lot, and they are likely[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) to get what they want.

#### Examples of the violence part

Let’s step back to our examples from earlier: the boardroom filled with men and the collaborative modeling session where the CTO participates. We established the symbolic part of these situations: in the boardroom, men usually have more symbolic power than women, and in the collaborative modeling session, the CTO has more symbolic power than others. So, what does the violence part look like in these situations? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Let’s say there is one woman in that men-dominated boardroom. She might position herself in a lower rank than the men in the room and adjust her behavior to that internalized power structure. She’s a woman, younger than the others, has fewer years of experience, and is less senior, but she does possess some magical powers—people are willing to listen to her, follow her, ask for advice, and trust her more than all the board members. Because of how she positions herself compared to others in the room, she might be quieter during board meetings. She might go last in question rounds, adding her agenda points last, and ask what others think of her ideas. This doesn’t mean the people higher in rank are consciously exerting their symbolic power or have bad intentions—not at all! This is the symbolic violence we do to ourselves. If there was a facilitator in that board meeting, they could make that ranking and symbolic violence explicit to help the group overcome it where desired by sharing what they observe in terms of behavior, explaining how ranking and symbolic violence works, and making the ranks in the group explicit.

The collaborative modeling situation is similar. Others in the room will be more likely to go with what the CTO suggests, ask the CTO for advice, and let that CTO speak first when they position themselves lower in rank than that CTO. They might think, “The CTO will probably know better due to all their experience, knowledge, and education, so I will shut up.” The same can happen during pair programming sessions, for example. Sometimes, juniors get paired up with seniors so they can learn from them, which, in theory, is a good idea with even better intentions. In reality, the symbolic power of the senior can cause the junior to not speak their mind, not challenge anything the senior says, and [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)learn absolutely nothing. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.1.4 Epistemic injustice

The intertwined relationship between ranking theory and epistemic injustice is important in collaborative modeling. Miranda Fricker introduced the term *epistemic injustice* in her book *Epistemic Injustice: Power & the Ethics of Knowing* (Oxford University Press, 2007) to describe the harm done to someone in their role as a knower. In collaborative software design—or, if you ask us, in all facets of software development—the focus is on learning and knowing. It’s the driver for what to build. Understanding the effect of this dynamic during collaborative modeling is essential.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Symbolic violence involves attributing power through symbols, leading individuals to downplay their contributions if they feel they rank lower. Epistemic injustice occurs when someone’s credibility as a source of knowledge is unfairly diminished due to biases linked to their identity, such as gender, race, or social class. A clear example is the often ignored or overlooked contributions from women and marginalized groups in IT, which becomes even more shocking when similar suggestions from others are readily accepted. Fricker refers to this as *testimonial injustice*, emphasizing the importance of embracing diverse perspectives in collaborative software design for crafting effective, adaptable software.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Additionally, the advent of AI has shed light on another aspect of epistemic injustice. The higher misidentification rates of people of color and women by AI-based facial recognition systems point to biases originating from nondiverse training datasets. Fricker names this *hermeneutical injustice*, which highlights interpretative gaps that obscure the experiences of certain social groups. For software design, this means that without comprehensive research or representation of diverse customer groups, products may fall short or exclude specific demographics, potentially harming the brand. The most concerning problem arises when groups not represented in AI datasets are inadvertently marginalized even further.

Abeba Birhane, a cognitive scientist specializing in human behavior, social systems, and ethical AI, offers an extensive collection of resources on this topic of automated systems and bias at [https://abebabirhane.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/1162/](https://abebabirhane.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/1162/).

Within software development, a similarity can be seen with epistemic injustice when developers, although not being a marginalized group as Fricker writes about, aren’t given access or input to domain knowledge, which is often justified as making things simpler or protecting them from the complexities. Such exclusion overlooks the valuable insights developers can offer in addressing domain challenges and promotes a perception of IT departments as mere “factories” tasked with executing solutions devised by architects, analysts, and product managers. While collaborative modeling seeks to involve developers more inclusively, especially developers from marginalized groups, it falls short if the problems of symbolic violence and epistemic injustice aren’t tackled among stakeholders and within development teams.

In our collaborative modeling sessions, we strive to grasp the interplay of symbolic power, epistemic injustice, and group ranking. We can foresee some of these dynamics through explicit rankings, but others emerge and need to be addressed in the sessions, especially with individuals in leadership roles, focusing on how to distribute their influence more equitably. This approach prepares us to delve deeper into the role of ranking in collaborative modeling and its effects on software systems, design, and architecture, which w[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ill be the focus of section 6.3.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

## 6.2 Becoming aware of ranking during collaboration and software design

In section 6.1.1, we already gave an example of ranking during a collaborative modeling session: a participant addressing all of their questions to the male facilitator even though the female facilitator was teaching the concepts. In this section, we’ll talk a bit more about patterns that we’ve observed over the years when it comes to ranking and how those patterns influence the design, architecture, and software system itself. We’re not the only ones who noticed these patterns, and some of them were given a name. We’re using those names, despite the negative connotation they often have, to make it easier for you to link back to your already-existing mental models around ranking. Please understand, [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)we don’t always like these names.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.2.1 Group ranking

Although each individual has a rank, a specific group inside the company also has a social status and a rank associated with that status. By being part of that group, the explicit or implicit rank of a person is influenced be[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)cause they are part of this group.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### Internal vs. external product teams

Parts of a software system in a company can be internally or externally facing. For the sake of simplicity, let’s take some liberty with the word *product* and call these the internal and external products of a company. When a company has both internal and external products, as is the case with BigScreen, the external products are perceived as contributing to the revenue streams, and the internal ones are seen as a necessary cost. These associations carried an implicit rank that has an effect on the budgets assigned to the teams. Internal teams get less budget because they are seen as less important. Money creates status, so because those teams have less money, they are seen as less important. This is called a *reinforcing loop*.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

When there is more budget, a team can hire more developers or hire for specific roles, such as architect or product owner, which other teams can’t do. After a while, the teams working on the internal products can’t keep up with the requests from the business. They start taking shortcuts, such as skipping tests or collaborating on the design. Certain design qualities go down, or the bug count in those products goes up. The decline in delivered quality also affects or confirms the i[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)mplicit lower ranking of those teams.

#### Core domain teams

Similar patterns can be detected between teams in the same “group,” depending on the type of subdomains they are working on. In Domain-Driven Design, there’s a distinction between three different types of subdomains:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

-  *Core domain*—This domain contains the business logic that is most important to the company and often is what sets the company apart on the market. It’s the reason you’re writing a customer software system.
-  *Supporting subdomains—*These domains still have business logic inside of them, but it’s not the market differentiator.
-  *Generic subdomains—*These domains are necessary to have a functioning company, but there is no specific business logic in there.

We notice in companies that the people who don’t work on the core domain have a lower ranking than the people who work on the core domain. The idea is that because they don’t work on the most important parts of the software system, their “unique abilities” (refer to figure 6.1) must be a lot less. There are a few consequences because of that. The first one is that their opinions or ideas get dismissed during collaborative modeling. The second one is that the supporting and generic subdomains are deemed as unimportant, which isn’t true, and their struggles get less attention during a collaborative modeling session. Yet, to have a good system design, you need to investigate those subdomains too. If you don’t, this will have a negative effect on the product. For example, even though the Payments bounded context from BigScreen is a generic subdomain, customers can’t finish purchasing a ticket if this part of the system isn’t functioning well, leading to more customers contacting the customer help desk and putting p[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ressure and stress on that department.

#### Low-ranking teams

One of the less obvious examples of ranking in collaborative modeling is the absence of a representative for a group of people during a session. Good examples of [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)this are the customer help desk or the system administrator (sysadmin). These roles are often associated with a lower implicit ranking and therefore overlooked when setting up a collaborative modeling session, even though they have insights into customers and infrastructure. It’s harder to detect this implicit ranking because the people associated with these [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)roles aren’t present during a session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.2.2 People

Ranking resides on an individual level of which group status is just a small part of the equation. Different people can also assign a different implicit rank to someone. On top of that, those rankings from different people can contradict the explicit ranking that somebody has. Let’s look at a few examples of patterns as[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)sociated with people instead of groups.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### The genius

When there is a developer that has been around for a very long time and therefore has a deep knowledge on the current system or who is seen as a g*enius* *developer*, their implicit ranking is high. The rest of the team looks at that person during collaborative modeling to lead them because of their deep knowledge of the current system. This great knowledge, which has helped out the team on many occasions and is seen as something amazing, also makes them struggle to talk to the business because they have a hard time letting go of the way the system already works. You’ll often hear sentences like these:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

-  You want us to also add a unique constraint for the email column in the user table? That will be hard because we’ll have to do some data cleanup because we didn’t have that constraint before.
-  That will be difficult because of how the system works right now. See, the way it works right now is that we send a request to the server, and so on.

This leads to very restricted modeling sessions that are often too focused on the technical details of the current system, causing the domain experts not to see the value of collaborative modeling. So, the implicit high ranking of genius developers has a negative effect on the collaborative modeling sessions and leads to even less collaboration with the domain experts.

##### NOTE

Take a moment to reflect on the different traits (for example gender, background, culture and so on) you initially attributed to this genius. What assumptions did you make, and what do they reveal about your own biases? Don't be too hard on yourself or view these thoughts as inherently wrong--they simply are, shaped by your experiences and surroundings. This reflection offers a valuable opportunity for growth and adjustment, should you feel it’s necessary.

The other team members also look to the genius developer to come up with good software design and models that fit the business. The solutions that they propose are based on the knowledge they already have and are less effective in dealing with changes coming from the business.

Sometimes, the genius goes by a different name, the dungeon master. The *dungeon master* was first mentioned by Alberto Brandolini in his “Rise and Fall of the Dungeon Master” blog post ([https://mng.bz/oex2](https://mng.bz/oex2)) as “deeply entrenched with the software, in fact they know the software better than anyone else. Even if they are no longer software developers, they are still at close distance from its creation.” A dungeon master is a genius but with one big difference: it’s not viewed as positive, so a dungeon master has a low implicit ranking. A person can be a genius to a higher manager (high implicit ranking) but be considered a dungeon master by their team members (low implicit ranking).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

A good example of a dungeon master/genius is the programming CTO. When a company is just starting, the CTO has a very good knowledge of how the system was designed and functions because they helped build it. After a while, the company becomes bigger, and the CTO has to dedicate less time to keeping their knowledge of the system up-to-date and starts focusing on other things. This is a normal evolution of a company. They don’t understand or have difficulty admitting that they lost track of all the changes that happened in the system, but they want to believe they still have the correct knowledge to advise. Because the CTO is explicitly ranked higher, a lot of people on the development teams find it difficult to go against their opinion, even though they realize that the CTO’s advice is based on outdated system knowledge. So, they implement the CTO’s advice or models, leading t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)o more accidental complexity or bad models.

#### Rockstar developer

We’ve seen many job applications asking for a rockstar developer. Companies think this is a cool way to advertise for a software developer position. The truth is, none of these companies would actually want a rockstar developer on their team. Let us explain what we mean. There is a paradox called *the preventable problem*, coined by product management consultant Shreyas Doshi: “Any complex organization will over time tend to incentivize problem creation more than problem prevention.” With *problem creation*, they don’t mean consciously creating problems when working at a company. It means it’s more beneficial for an employee to let problems arise and fix them, than to prevent them. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Rockstar developers get their high implicit, and sometimes explicit rank because they fall in the first category of this. Urgent user requests piling up? Rockstars are the first to make a real dent in it! (Code quality be damned.) Bug in the system? You know who is the first to fix! (Maybe we should pay more attention to that code quality.) Server down at night? They are the first ones behind their computer! (Why is that server running out of memory so often anyway?) Management knows them and loves them. Who wouldn’t? They are rockstars, after all! You can’t blame rockstar developers for how they operate because the company rewards this type of behavior. We want to be appreciated, we want to be seen as extremely good at our jobs, we want that pay raise that goes with that, and problem prevention doesn’t really accomplish that. Nobody at work ever talks about that time that you did such a good job, the microservice just worked. So no, a company doesn’t really want a rockstar developer. Problem prevention is far more beneficial for the so[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ftware system and the company in the long run.

#### Testers

Testers are another group of people that are often seen as lower in ranking. Testers are very good at finding bugs and flaws in the software system, but their input is often used in a reactive way instead of a proactive one. When you use the full potential of a tester in a proactive way, they are part of the development lifecycle and can prevent a flawed design fr[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)om being implemented and pushed to production.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### Silent person

Another example is the silent person in the room, which is the opposite of the genius status from the first section. Some people have difficulty expressing their views or concerns to the group, so they have an implicit lower ranking. Because they are perceived as lower in ranking, the group doesn’t take the time to understand the person’s concerns, or their ideas are easily dismissed, as a result, certain problems with the chosen design only become apparent when the solution [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)is already implemented and pushed to production.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

#### The new one

Ever hired a new developer who immediately started to suggest that you change the way the team works because that is what they did at their old company and it worked really well? They suggest it so often, it even comes a bit annoying? Yes, so have we. One of the reasons they do that is because they want to prove themselves. They want to feel like they have a good rank in the team or confirm their explicit rank (“yes, I am really senior”).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Take software architects, for example, who are often perceived as higher in ranking. When they join a company, they want to make a good impression and “improve” the architecture. Every architect has their own preferences or definition of what a good architecture is, so they push for their definition. For example, the new architect believes that microservices should be bigger than the last architect did. Even though the team is still working toward the architecture that the previous architect designed, the new architect decides it’s time to start merging microservices again. This change of direction is well intended, but not beneficial for your software system. Halfway through a redesign, swapping directions again will cause the overall design and architecture to become messy. It’s also not beneficial for team morale and will affect the implicit ranking of the architect in a negative way. Instead of proving that their explicit high rank is correct, they just lowered their implicit rank. This will make it more difficult for them to do their job and affect the system architecture [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)even more negatively, even if their ideas are good.

#### Peter principle

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)The last pattern we want to discuss here is called *the Peter principle*. It’s a pattern within management that was developed by Canadian educator Laurence J. Peter. This principle states that eventually somebody will be promoted into a position where they become incompetent. A good example from the software world is a developer. They st[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)art as a junior developer, and they get promoted to medior and senior. The next step in the promotion ladder is Team Lead, Technical Lead, or Engineering Manager. These developers are excellent developers, which is why they get promoted, but being a team lead requires a vastly different set of skills than being a developer. Higher management won’t promote them further because this person isn’t competent at their new job and demoting them isn’t something management can just do. So now they are stuck in that position. Although their explicit ranking is high, it’s different from their implicit ranking, which is a lot lower. Due to the implicit ranking, the team dismisses their input and ideas quickly without real consideration. Imagine this person tries to introduce collaborative modeling to the team. The impression they have of this person would be projected upon the idea that they are trying to introduce. The team would not give this a fair try because it’s very hard [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)for people to separate the person from the message.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### Exercise 6.2

Have a conversation with your own team about ranking within teams: Do you experience an effect of ranking when it comes to collaboration? You could start this conversation in a team meeting by asking open-ended questions. You could consider the following questions:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

-  Have you ever felt like the most or least knowledgeable person in the room? Anyone want to share their example?
-  Have you ever withheld opinions or ideas because you thought they weren’t good enough? Anyone want to share their example?
-  Have you ever experienced or felt a power play during group sessions? If so, how did you notice?
-  Do you experience any effect of power in our/this team? If so, can you provide an example?

If you’d like, also discuss the different “roles” that were mentioned in section 6.2.2. Ask i[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)f they perceive them in your own team and organization.

## 6.3 Facilitating ranking

You might be able to imagine now that ranking plays a crucial role in collaborative modeling, and, as facilitators, we can influence it. Let’s now dive in and explore a Big Picture EventStorming that took place at BigScreen with 30 participants from different parts of the organization collaborating on one model. In our experience facilitating these sessions, people from these different parts of the organization have never met before. In these situations, people tend to unconsciously assess their rank compared to others, causing uncertainty and lowering psychological safety. Have you ever been in that situation, walking in on a session without knowing everyone in the room? What did that do to you, and how did you behave?[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

We most certainly have experienced that. We have a saying in Dutch of “looking the cat out of the tree,” meaning we’re cautious and first watch what happens. We feel uncertain about what we can and can’t say and what we should or shouldn’t do in such a group. That uncertainty, in turn, restricts the flow of information, lowers collaboration, and makes the outcome of the session not include the full wisdom of the group. Even if the group is familiar with each other, higher-ranking individuals may suffer from dominance blindness, where they fail to recognize or acknowledge the privileges and advantages they have and fail to understand the daily effect it has on someone with lower ranking. While those lower in rank are more susceptible to symbolic violence. To better understand the effect of ranking, we’ll reflect first on past sessions where we weren’t fully aware of its effects, and then we’ll explore ways to see[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) how we could have led more effectively as facilitators.

### 6.3.1 Analyzing the group rank

One of the first times we facilitated a Big Picture EventStorming, it didn’t go fully as we expected. We made sure to include the correct people—26 in total of one department of a company. Everyone mostly knew each other, and they held quarterly planning sessions together. Not everyone would work together on a weekly basis, but at least they would do so during those planning sessions. We actually attended one of these sessions before we organized the Big Picture EventStorming, so we knew who to involve. We had the full support of the head of engineering, and he believed the session would help him align the domain model to one overview. Back then, these collaborative modeling sessions, such as Big Picture EventStorming, were hard to plan with most organizations. You really had to persuade certain people. So, we were thrilled that we got support from someone high up with explicit ranking this time.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Let someone with a high explicit ranking introduce you to the group you will facilitate.

We thoroughly planned the Big Picture EventStorming as outlined in chapter 4. The head of engineering, who was fully supportive of the session, communicated the goal and agenda in one of their weekly updates and sent out the invitation to the necessary participants. We also prepared a check-in question and some sensemaking exercises to enhance the session. With everyone on board and fully engaged, we were confident that the Big Picture EventStorming would be a success, and we got right to it.

During the session, we divided the large group into two smaller groups for a check-in exercise. We asked the participants about what was working well and what needed improvement in the current process. The explicitly higher-ranking individuals didn’t dominate the conversation, and the responses from each group were quite similar. So, we didn’t have the feeling from the check-in that people were afraid to speak up.

We then began the chaotic exploration step in Big Picture EventStorming. We asked the participants to write down all of their domain events as they happen currently. However, some of the group got stuck and were talking among themselves. When we asked what was holding them back, someone mentioned not knowing the level of granularity to write the events at. That question is asked a lot during a Big Picture EventStorming, and we always explain that the goal was to get a complete overview of the business process, not to be overly concerned with accuracy. We want to get everyone’s model out and get an entire overview of the business processes and how they group them together in smaller processes. We emphasized that we were using sticky notes, and any inaccuracies in the granularity of the domain events could be adjusted later.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)Our answer took away that person’s concern, and the moment they wrote down and put their stickies up, we noticed other people started doing the same thing. We took note, but didn’t see it as a huge concern at the time thanks to something called cognitive bias, but we’ll talk more on that in the next chapter. So, we continued and ended up with a huge 20-meter wall with roughly 500 domai[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)n events sorted in a timeline, as shown in figure 6.2.

After writing down roughly 500 domain events, the group is tasked with merging them into a single, consistent timeline in the enforcing the timeline step of EventStorming. This is where the collaboration, communication, and learning process truly begins. However, in this particular instance, the group quickly diverged into a discussion about the way some individuals wrote their domain events. Despite being instructed to model the current state, some members wrote down events they wished to see in the future, causing conflict within the group. (We’ll talk more about resolving conflicts in chapter 8.) One person seemed to lead that discussion against the head of engineering and had some other people in the group that agreed with their point of view. This was the second time an individual who seemed not to be explicitly high in rank was able to lead and influence the session because we had not been aware of [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)the symbols of power in the culture of the organization.

![Figure 6.2 An example of the outcome of the Big Picture EventStorming step 1: chaotic exploration. Some people might already group domain events together, and some people might make their own timeline for themselves.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH06_F02_Baas.png)

#### Participatory observation

Leading collaborative modeling sessions and effectively facilitating a group requires that one is given the power to do so. However, simply having explicit power isn’t enough. It’s also important to be aware of implicit power dynamics within the group, as these individuals may also hold influence over the rest of the group. To identify those with implicit power, it’s recommended to observe the symbols of the culture of an organization. Shared symbols make social interaction possible and usually create reactions and emotions. To observe these symbols, we can learn from anthropologists.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

*Participatory observation* is a method used by anthropologists to observe a culture from inside. This is known as the *emic perspective* and represents the lived experience of an individual within the culture. In the context of a Big Picture EventStorming session, for instance, a person might experience fear of writing down the wrong events, so they wait until someone else puts up an example event. By collecting and analyzing these stories, we can give our own conclusion or judgment as to why that has happened. Anthropologists call this the *etic perspective*, and it’s how an outsider experiences that same culture. Participatory observation helps us understand the culture’s emic perspective and make more informed judgments about the power dynamics at play. For us it’s important to look at an organization through an anthropologist view to understand the implicit ranking and how participatory observation can help with that.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### Note

If you want to learn more about the work that anthropologists do, we recommend Danielle Braun and Jitske Kramer’s book, *The Corporate Tribe: Organizational Lessons from Anthropology* (Routledge, 2019).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

At the start of our engagement with BigScreen, we took time to familiarize ourselves with the organization’s practices and routines. This involved attending team sessions such as dailies, refinements, retrospectives, and other operational meetings the teams have. But we also went to the coffee corner, had lunch, and especially liked playing table tennis or Mario Kart after lunch. According to Braun and Kramer, entry is crucial in any new environment. Before you can truly observe the emic perspective, you need to build trust. That’s why we introduced ourselves clearly, explaining our role as support for the development team in successfully delivering the project, with the goal of understanding their needs and addressing any pain points.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Entry is everything, so make sure the first time you join a new group, team, or organization, you have a good introduction. Be humble and open to retain your neutrality.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

We were careful not to present ourselves as the “fixers” of the project, as this can lead to resistance and suspicion from the team. Perhaps you’ve been on a team where they “flew” in a consultant to fix the problem you didn’t know you had. What did you notice happening to you? We’ve been in that situation and felt resistant and suspicious of sharing our information, did you? Instead, we approached the situation with humbleness and openness. By doing so, we were able to build a connection with all the teams and they started to share information with us during their meetings.

Another important aspect when entering a new environment is to make sure you’re not perceived as being “of a person or group.” When people perceive you as being of a person or a group it can affect your neutrality and implicit ranking. Yes, in our situation, our engagement was to support the development team, but that doesn’t mean we can’t hang out with other teams such as marketing, business administration, and the back office-supporters. Go have lunch with them, ask to sit for a couple of hours next to the customer supporters, and see what type of work they do. You’ll be amazed what stories you can capture from that.

##### Note

What about user research, UX and UI designers? If you’re familiar with user research, UX and UI design, you’ll recognize the approach we’re taking. We believe that user research can bring significant value to software teams and that UX designers and developers can benefit from working together more often. After all, both groups have the same ultimate goal: to solve the problems faced by our users in the best way possible. This doesn’t mean that we think developers should take over the role of user research, UX and UI designers, but rather that the two communities should collaborate more frequently to achieve this shared goal.

At BigScreen, we observed a lot of stories surrounding the development team. For instance, the marketing team asked how it’s possible that it takes so much time to change a simple form that will make their work a lot easier. They also mentioned that every time developers release a new feature, it’s not what they want, even though they clearly told Ralph, the product owner, their requirements. Capturing these types of anecdotes can tell us the emic perspective and make a model of the implicit ranking of an organization.

![Figure 6.3 An example map of how to model the organization and capture symbols, anecdotes, and our own thoughts. In reality, this would be a lot bigger, so we like to use online tools where we can easily enlarge the area and collaborate on capturing our observations.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH06_F03_Baas.png)

To better understand these experiences, we like to capture them in a map, similar to an organizational diagram or stakeholder mapping, as shown in figure 6.3. This allows us to see the emic perspective, that is, the implicit ranking of the organization. We include anecdotes shared with us, as well as observations of the office culture, such as seating arrangements and work styles. Interestingly, we saw some teams have a fixed seating arrangement, while others have a more flexible setup. However, there were flyers at the coffee corner promoting a flexible and hybrid way of working, which didn’t seem to reflect how all teams are working. Jack and Rose from the development team w[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ere always at the office, while others worked more flexibly. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Because there is only so much you can observe by participating in these sessions, we also started[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) planning interviews to grasp more information about the culture.

#### Conducting interviews

During our engagements, the first interviews we conduct with individuals will always be unstructured. We have a plan based on the observations we already gathered through participatory observation, and informal interviews in between sessions. However, our aim is to capture as much information as possible by allowing the conversation to naturally flow and using our active listening skills to follow the direction the person being interviewed wants to go in. It’s important to start by stressing the confidentiality of the interview and assuring the person that the information gathered won’t be directly linked to them. To start, we ask a question to gauge their expectations or perception of the engagement, such as “What are your expectations from our engagement?” or “How do you see our engagement being done?”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Here is the hardest part of the interview process. The interview requires a delicate balance of active listening and capturing as much information as possible. To make this easier, we usually conduct interviews with two people—one to write and the other for active listening and conducting the interview. We use an online whiteboard to capture notes, which is instantly shared with others, as we did for the map in figure 6.3. What we’re looking for are shared symbols we spoke about earlier, such as the one we observed in a conversation among developers who were focused on finishing their user stories on time to meet their promised estimations. That might not sound weird to anyone who has worked in agile organizations, but we can observe a symbol we called “promising to deliver.” During the interviews, we avoid jumping to conclusions, but through participatory observations and interviews, we identify symbols of power, such as delivering on time, resulting in implicit ranking. Delivering on time might not sound like a symbol at first, but more like an ability that is related to skills. Although that is true, the power others yield to a person because of that ability and thus consistently delivering on time, increases ranking. For example, people from operations always contact Jack and Rose, as they can always quickly provide the information they need.

In section 5.2.1, we discussed how we can enhance active listening by drawing insights from the field of anthropology, particularly through their approach to qualitative research. One technique, known as ethnographic writing, is especially useful in helping us set aside our own judgments and remain more objective in our understanding. The book *Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes* (Chicago University Press, 2011) is a good read for that. It gives you tips and tricks on how to write during these interviews. The basic trap you can fall into is that your own shadows and especially emotions don’t matter for observing the patterns that are happening in the group. But if you try your best to ignore them, they will distract you. One thing anthropologists do is write those down in their field notes, so they won’t be a distraction and can be left behind. These notes will also give you the insight to reflect after the interviews and do inner work for yourself later on. These field notes will greatly help us in o[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ur work and to facilitate the sessions later on.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When you struggle to stay neutral as a facilitator, write down ethnographic field notes, and especially write down your shadows so you can start to reflect on these. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

If you’re a consultant like us, you might also do short engagements with customers to do just a couple of collaborative modeling sessions. In these cases, unstructured interviews may not provide you with the necessary information for identifying symbols of power in your collaborative modeling session. In these scenarios, semi-structured interviews may be more appropriate. These interviews have specific topics that focus on the goal of collaborative modeling. You can ask questions related to the goal of the session, such as what the person hopes to achieve or if they see any obstacles in reaching the goal. It’s important to focus on both opposing aspects of the goal of a session.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Before organizing cross-organizational collaborative modeling, do semi-structured interviews to collect the symbols of power that can determine the implicit ranking.

In our BigScreen engagement, we did semi-structured interviews after the unstructured one, just before we started doing collaborative modeling sessions. During these interviews, several participants expressed interest in the sessions but also questioned what would be done with the results. We noted a particular conflict between two developers, Jack and Rose, who were both very open and talkative during the interviews. We also noticed how others perceived their conflict, especially during our interview with Kala, who is the most senior developer. She seems to come over as someone who is somewhat shy and humble. She told us she wasn’t asked to be involved in the previous decision to move forward. She also worked hard to implement the previous code and used a lot of design patterns that, in her mind, were what they decided. She was very annoyed that she was kept out of the loop and felt embarrassed reporting back to stakeholders that they needed to refactor a lot. These interviews made us assume we would see another symbol of power—being outspoken and direct—instead of shy, reserved, and humble being a symbol of power. There were several observations that gave us that assumption, but the most outspoken example is that Kala, with her experience, wasn’t involved during decision-making. Again, being outspoken and direct might seem like characteristics instead of symbols of power at first glance. It’s the power others yield to these traits that increases ranking. Note that this is highly context dependent. In other contexts, being outspoken and direct might decrease ranking.

![Figure 6.4 Filled-in preparation template for the Big Picture EventStorming we did together with Meera, the CTO at BigScreen. We connected the goal of the session with the shared need we extracted from the interviews.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH06_F04_Baas.png)

It’s important to note that conducting interviews prior to collaborative modeling sessions can help you establish yourself as a facilitator and gain implicit ranking. During these semi-structured interviews, focus on the needs of the individual, what they expect from the session, and how it can help them. Ask them what they need during the session and be clear about what you can and can’t provide. Don’t sell empty promises that give people expectations you can’t fulfill because that will lower your ranking in the group that wants you to lead and facilitate them. These interviews provide context for the group you’re facilitating, which can help make the session more collaborative and safer. If you already have enough information about the group, you may not need to conduct interviews. The goal is to understand the current symbols of power and ranking, which can help you gain ranking to create a safe space for collaboration from the start of the session.

After we gained a clear understanding, we were confident in organizing the Big Picture EventStorming at BigScreen. Together with Meera, the CTO, we used the preparation template as discussed in chapter 4, which you can see in figure 6.4. With this template, Meera could plan and invite the right people for the session, emphasizing her importance for the success of the project. During the interviews, most people expressed their concern about the campaign, mentioning that they were worried about the effect it will have on their work. They also mentioned that they felt those concerns weren’t being taken seri[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)ously because those concerns might delay the deadlines Ralph has.

To address this, we incorporated their concerns into the phrasing of the session’s goal. Meera explained the goal in her invitation email, emphasizing the needs of the participants we extracted from the interviews. By connecting with their needs, we eliminated confusion and created a need and motivation for them to attend. We don’t want to force people to attend these sessions, but show them that the session will help them and meet the organization’s concerns. We also sought feedback on the email to ensure its clarity. We aim to close the feedback loop and continuously observe, allowing us to make adjustments to how we facilitate the session where necessary.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.3.2 Own, play, and share your rank

On the day of the Big Picture EventStorming, we arrived early to set up the room, ensuring we had at least an hour to prepare. We put up the paper roll; wrote the agenda, goal, and session explanation on the flip chart; and, most importantly, welcomed each participant personally. When you put people across silos from an organization into one room for a Big Picture EventStorming, you want people to feel comfortable from the start. You might be able to relate by thinking about how you feel when entering a room with people you either hardly know or never met, and you start to rank yourself against others. We need enough safety to know who can do or say what and, especially, what is my place here. So, the first moments a group gets together, it’s important to make it just clear enough for people to start feeling comfortable. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Remember in section 4.4 we said we start our training with an exercise where we introduce EventStorming to a group of strangers and begin within the first 5 minutes. The atmosphere can become tense and uncomfortable for both attendees and facilitators. The reason for this is that the participants don’t yet know each other’s positions and rankings, leading to awkward silence. As a facilitator, it’s crucial to establish a sense of safety for the participants by taking the lead. Before the session even begins, you need to establish yourself as a leader so that the attendees feel comfortable and know who to turn to if they feel uneasy. When people are in unfamiliar situations, they naturally look for someone to follow, so it’s essential to provide them with a leader they can trust. That leader should own up to that rank, make sur[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)e they keep the rank by playing it, and then share it with the people.

#### Owning your rank

As facilitators, we get explicit ranking to organize and start a collaborative modeling session, which is usually granted to us by people who have that power in the organization. Owning up to that rank is important for us as facilitators because it establishes our authority and sets clear expectations for our role in the group. Owning our rank can help establish a sense of safety and comfort for participants, as they know who to turn to for guidance or support during the session. Without owning our rank, there may be confusion or ambiguity about who is leading the session, which can lead to a lack of direction or disagreements among participants. Participants may not feel comfortable sharing their ideas or asking questions, leading to a lack of engagement and a missed opportunity for collaboration and innovation. The session might end in chaos.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)Not owning your rank can also be condescending and disrespectful to the participants. We might not own our rank because we want to be equal to others, which we think is a good value to have. But if we’re honest, we’re not equal to the participants, just as a CTO isn’t equal to the employees. We’ve been given certain power to lead the session, to facilitate it, to actually decide on the process the participants can’t. Not owning your rank can then signal that you’re not taking responsibility for your role and the success of the session. It can undermine the trust that the group has in you as a facilitator. If they sense that you’re not willing to take the lead and guide them through the process, they may start to question your expertise and credibility. Owning your rank and taking responsibility to lead the session doesn’t[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) mean you should treat people disrespectfully or unequally differently.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When you’re high in rank as a facilitator, welcome everyone personally to the session and let them feel welcomed and comfortable.

To have a successful session, it’s important to establish yourself as the leader and facilitator from the beginning. Start by introducing yourself as the person leading the session when participants join the meeting room. When the session starts, let the person who invited everyone kick it off. If that’s us, we introduce ourselves. With the Big Picture EventStorming at BigScreen, we had Meera kick off the session and explain its importance, after which, she made it clear that we would be facilitating the session. When we took over, we made sure to properly introduce ourselves and explain what participants could expect from us. We discussed the agenda, roles, and safety rules of the session. It’s important that all participants agree on the safety rules. We start with adding the “nobody holds the monopoly to the truth” safety rule from the Lewis Deep Democracy methodology[6](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/footnote-000) to promote an open discussion. If the session is online, we also add the “disable all unnecessary notifications and communications programs” safety rule. We ensure that everyone is on the same page, and we have the group explicitly agree to the rules by raising their hands. Now participants can also add safety rules themselves. During the session, safety rules can be changed or added as long as the entire group agrees. If there is a disagreement, it’s important to address it befor[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)e moving forward. We’ll talk more about managing conflict in chapter 8.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When you’re in a session where working agreements aren’t explicit, set up safety rules that the group collaboratively agrees with. That[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) way, you can always refer back to them if those safety rules are broken.

#### Playing your rank

Now that we’ve established ourselves and are owning our rank, it’s equally or more important to play your rank. It’s crucial to understand the distinction between leaders with *explicit* ranking, such as those in an organization’s hierarchy, and leaders with *implicit* ranking, those chosen by the group based on social power. Because of the social power, our rank is in constant flux and depends on the culture’s symbols of power. That makes it a very interesting topic but also a hard one to grasp as a facilitator because if we want to keep our rank, we should actively play our rank. Changes to our nonverbal behavior or our communication style can influence that rank so we can then share it with the group, giving people in the group power to express themselves. That’s why it helps to know and understand the symbols of power of a group before the session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### note

There’s a growing movement to create software teams that are self-steering, autonomous, and don’t require direct management. While we think this is a great idea and support the notion of teams that can steer themselves, it’s important to remember that we still need leaders. Without a clear hierarchy, people might start to wonder who’s making decisions. If we don’t establish and collaboratively design an alternative hierarchy that’s inclusive and fair, things could quickly become chaotic and unsafe for everyone involved. In these situations, the strongest and most influential people tend to rise to the top, which can be detrimental to creating a safe, equal, and inclusive work environment.

During the Big Picture EventStorming at BigScreen, we focused on being outspoken and the importance to deliver symbols of power we analyzed. We gave the participants 20 minutes to write down their first set of events during the chaotic exploration phase, and we provided time updates at the 5-minute and 2-minute mark. It’s crucial to ensure everyone has enough time to express themselves, so we also asked if anyone needed more time. We were mindful that there may be people in the group who don’t align with the traditional symbols of power, so we made sure to provide enough space for them to contribute. It’s important to play our rank as facilitators without losing the trust of those who may be in the minority. Building this trust is crucial when trying to gain implicit ranking and share it with others.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

As facilitator, favor more passive participation at the start of a collaborative session, and then transition into more active participation.

During the Big Picture EventStorming, we made sure to actively participate in the group discussions by asking questions or giving comments on the events that were put up. This was a change in our usual approach of being more observant at the beginning, but we knew the importance of playing our rank as facilitators. However, playing your rank can be tiring, especially if the cultural symbols of power are different from your own. If you’re a shy, reserved, and humble person, you may struggle to assert your rank. Sometimes, you can’t even play the rank because the person you are is by default lower in rank. For example, in cultures where being a tall white male is a symbol of power, anyone else will struggle. In such cases, it may be necessary to have another facilitator who can represent that part of the group. In our Big Picture EventStormings, we always have at least two facilitators, one who can actively play the rank and another who can observe more passively. This way, we build trust with different people from the group, and the majority and minority are represented.

#### Sharing your rank

Owning and playing your rank can help you gain enough influence within the group to share that influence with all participants. This helps to make the collaborative modeling process easier for everyone involved. During our Big Picture EventStorming session at BigScreen, we knew that shy, introverted, and humble individuals may have a harder time being heard by the group. By using our rank, we can make it safe for them to speak up and ensure that those who are dominating the conversation give others a chance to share their opinions. When someone with lower rank speaks up, we can help to amplify their voice and give them a platform to express themselves in the group. Because we have explicit and implicit rank, people are more likely to accept behavior from us that they might not accept from others in their culture. By sharing our rank, we can allow leadership to emerge from the group as a collective responsibility, rather than being the responsibility of a single individual. Ultimately, we want the group to take collective responsibility, and sharing rank with everyone in the group is an important part of achieving that goal.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

##### Note

The concepts of owning, playing, and sharing your rank come from Danielle Braun and Jitske Kramer. They talk about the importance of these concepts in their books, so we’ve [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)included two of them in the further reading list at the end of the chapter.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

### 6.3.3 Making the group aware of their rank

Groups and cultures can become coagulated, and get stuck in their behaviors because these behaviors provide a sense of meaning and safety within the group. We like to be safe, and any change in the group can be seen as a threat and be rejected. Ranking is a crucial factor, as those in higher positions often decide what is acceptable within the culture and tend to promote people who are similar to them. This can lead to a lack of adaptability and resistance to change and will end up in what we call *groupthink*. Groupthink results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome in a team, and thus also in collaborative software design. As facilitators, it’s our responsibility to help the group move past groupthink, and learn to include new ideas. One thing that will help the group become aware of groupthink is the use of sensemaking.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

Sensemaking (as explained in chapter 5) can get a group to change the current rank and even let them become aware of their rank. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, we can use tools such as the Mindell test we showed in figure 6.1 to create an understanding of people higher and lower in the group. At the Big Picture EventStorming at BigScreen, we added a sensemaking exercise right after the check-in. Here, we can use the information again that was gathered from the interviews. As mentioned, the concern was the effect this campaign would have on their work. Right after the check-in, we did a sensemaking exercise asking them from low to high how much they think the campaign would affect their work. We did this in the room, and let people stand in a line. But if we would have done it online, it would look like figure 6.5.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

After the check-in, use a sensemaking exercise to confirm if everyone is on board with the session’s goal.

We then invited people from both sides to speak up about why they placed themselves on that specific part. Doing a sensemaking exercise at the start makes sure to validate that we’re tackling the right problem of the group. It also connects the participants wi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)th the challenge before we start tackling it, enabling them to fully engage.

![Figure 6.5 An outcome of a sensemaking exercise diving into the pain points of the group to clearly see the disconnect between the participants.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH06_F05_Baas.png)

During the Big Picture EventStorming, we kept doing this sensemaking focused on getting more understanding between the groups and helping people in higher ranks to become aware of their own rank. We also asked the participants at some point about how important the deadline is. We again formed a line from not important to important, and this time made them discuss their position in groups of three to four. These groups are formed by someone from the left side, someone from the right, and someone from the middle. That way, people got to understand each side of that symbol of power, and people became aware of why it is or isn’t important to deliver. After 10–15 minutes, we let each breakout group explain what they discussed and bring it back to the group. Those conversations created space for the people lower in rank to express their need and gave an opportunity for change [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)for the people in higher rank to accept and start supporting the entire group.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

After a sensemaking exercise on ranking, split up the group to smaller breakouts with people from the left, right, and middle of the line.

It’s important to always focus sensemaking on the session at hand, blending it within the session, and not overdoing it. Find the natural moments in the session you can do these; they usually show them[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)selves in the form of polarities (we’ll talk more on polarities in chapter 9).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

## 6.4 Collaborative software design catalysts

-  Write down symbols of power that you see in a group you’re currently working with. This could be your team, people you’re working with in your organization, or a group of people who are doing collaborative modeling. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)
-  Before your next meeting, check who is invited, and determine which individuals you consider powerful and which less powerful. Why did you make those choices? How could that affect the meeting and outcomes? Try to write down specific behaviors or traits.
-  In the next session you’re facilitating, let someone with a high explicit ranking introduce you to the group you will facilitate.
-  When you expect power gradients or rankings to have an effect on an upcoming session, discuss your thoughts with highly ranked participants. Discuss what the goals of the session are, and strategize for it in terms of ranking. If your goal is to be complete and let everyone speak their thoughts, then make sure people higher in rank don’t share their thoughts first.
-  Reflect with your team on how ranking affects your collaboration.
-  Consider using a sensemaking technique to start a conversation about ranking. For example, place a dot on a line for the following question: “Do you experience a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)n effect of ranking on this team?” Let[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/) them go from “not at all” to “absolutely.”

## 6.5 Chapter heuristics

*Guiding heuristics*[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)

-  Let someone with a high explicit ranking introduce you to the group you will facilitate.
-  Entry is everything, so make sure the first time you join a new group, team, or organization, you have a good introduction. Be humble and open to retain your neutrality.
-  Write ethnographic field notes, especially your shadows, so you can start to reflect on these. That insight can help you stay more neutral as a facilitator.
-  Before organizing cross-organizational collaborative modeling, do semi-structured interviews to collect the symbols of power that can determine the implicit ranking.
-  When you’re high in rank as a facilitator, welcome everyone personally to the session and let them feel welcomed and comfortable.
-  When you’re in a session where working agreements aren’t explicit, set up safety rules that the group collaboratively agrees with. That way, you can always refer back to them if those safety rules are broken.
-  As facilitator, favor more passive participation at the start of a collaborative session, and then transition into more active participation.
-  Facilitate Big Picture EventStorming with two people who can represent different power symbols of the group.
-  After the check-in, use a sensemaking exercise to confirm if everyone is on board with the session’s goal.
-  After a sensemaking exercise on ranking, split up the group to smaller breakouts with people from the left, right, and middle of the line.

## Summary

-  Ranking is a position in a social hierarchy that shapes our thinking and behavior.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-6/)
-  Explicit rankings are the related powers that one is perceived to have because of their position in the visible hierarchy like an organization chart.
-  Implicit rankings are the related powers that one is perceived to have because of other characteristics, such as status, gender, education, skin color, age, knowledge, experience, and so on.
-  Symbolic violence describes nonphysical violence between two people or two groups of people with different ranking.
-  It can be a highly vulnerable experience to acknowledge or establish ranks in a group. Be mindful of this sensitivity and facilitate this properly.
-  Highly ranked people (explicit or implicit ranking) often take up a lot of space during collaborative modeling, while people who have a lower ranking during collaborative modeling have a harder time being heard.
-  Ranking during collaborative modeling can lead to overly complex designs, shallow models, and messy software architecture.
-  Teams lower in ranking will be under a lot more pressure because they often don’t get the resources required to implement new features, maintain their part of the system, and still deliver on time.
-  As a facilitator, you need to make your explicit rank as leader clear during a collaborative modeling session.
-  Before a collaborative modeling session, try to understand the power dynamic in the company and between the stakeholders you’re inviting.
-  During a collaborative modeling session, make people aware of each other’s implicit rank. Additionally, create sensemaking exercises to show the division on difficult topics.
