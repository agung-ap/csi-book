### This chapter covers

- Conflict and resistance, and why they occur
- Conflict and resistance in collaborative modeling
- The effect of resistance and conflict on software design
- Resolving and facilitating conflict and resistance

In the previous two chapters, we discussed ranking and cognitive biases and the effect they have on your software design and architecture. The following social-related topic that we’ll cover that has a major influence on your software design and architecture is conflict and resistance.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

First, we’ll walk you through what conflict and resistance are exactly and what type of behaviors you might observe. Next, we’ll discuss how conflict and resistance show up during collaborative modeling and the effect they both have on your software design and architecture. Lastly, we’ll teach you a few techniques you can use while facilitating collaborative modeling[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/).

## 8.1 Why people show resistance and have conflicts

In general, conflict has a very negative connotation and is seen as something that should be avoided. This is partly due to people’s definition of conflict. Whenever the word *conflict* pops up, we imagine people getting angry, yelling at each other, and slamming doors. *Resistance* on the other hand, can also be seen in a more positive light. We associate it with movies like *Star Wars*, where brave people fight against an evil institution that has taken over the universe. Unfortunately, neither one of those are accurate depictions of what conflict and resistance actually are. In this section, we’ll dive a bit deeper into the meaning of these two terms[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/).[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

### 8.1.1 What conflict is all about

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)Let’s start with conflict. The heavy clashing between two people is just one form of conflict—an extreme one. Before people reached this level of conflict, it was simmering underneath the surface for a while. There was a conflict, we just didn’t consider it one. In its most basic form, a *conflict* is a difference of opinion between two or more people. There is nothing inherently negative about it. Conflict is natural. Most of the conflicts we encounter in our lives aren’t memorable. We disagree with another person, have a discussion about it, and come up with a satisfying resolution. We move on and don’t even consider it a conflict.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

We want to emphasize the distinction between functional or task-based conflict and dysfunctional or relationship conflict.[1](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-006) *Functional conflict* occurs in the form of healthy and constructive disagreements. These functional conflicts are mainly focused on content and tasks, and they can drive progress, innovation, and growth. This is the type of conflict you don’t want to avoid because it will help you grow. The other type of conflict—*dysfunctional conflict*—is often more revolved around emotions and individuals. These conflicts can be unhealthy, hinder the group from progressing, and can reinforce power dynamics, for instance the negative effect on ranking can become larger. Dysfunctional conflicts harm relationships and can increase psychological unsafety within a grou[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)p. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Whenever you encounter a conflict, determine if it’s a functional, task-based, or dysfunctional relationship conflict. Do this by figuring out if it’s task related or emotion related, and if it’s helping or hindering progress and outcome.

Dismissing ideas or opinions without fully understanding them isn’t uncommon in a company. That is when problems start arising. Yet, investigating all opinions or alternatives is what leads to more sustainable decisions. When we don’t dig into the different perspectives, people might start to feel that their opinions aren’t being valued enough. They also have difficulties expressing that their opinions are not valued enough, so it’s not always obvious to detect. The conflict retreats into the shad[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ows.

##### The odd one out

In every company there is a “Harry.” Harry[2](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-005) stands for the person in the room whose ideas always sound crazy or unachievable. Their opinions on the topic are being dismissed or not taken seriously. People make jokes or comments about this person, often in front of them. When a new person joins the group, they get informed not to take Harry too seriously: “Yeah, that’s Harry, always having crazy opinions, don’t mind them too much!”

This behavior of everyone toward this person is causing conflict, which people aren’t aware of. Harry is also the person that will laugh with you when the group is mocking them. Yet, investigating Harry’s ideas could trigger other ideas or realizations you otherwise wouldn’t have. So don’t dismiss Harry that easily, and be a Harry once in a while yourself. You might be surprised at what you come up with because you’re examining crazy solutions.

The behavior of dysfunctional conflict does follow a certain path[3](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-004) when it comes to how conflicts develop and escalate. Nobody follows this path to the letter, and it’s possible for people to skip stages or show behavior from multiple stages at once. These stages help us in observing the behavior of people to find out if there is a dysfunctional conflict happening or brewing and how much it has escala[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ted.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Tension and taboo

Whenever a certain topic is brought up, the atmosphere starts to get tense. Sometimes the tension gets so high that the topic can’t be discussed anymore. It becomes taboo to talk about[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) it.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Double messages

In chapter 5 we discussed Gerald Weinberg’s “The incongruence insight,” which are double messages. These double messages refer to when you’re saying one thing, but behaving or meaning something else. Because the topic is taboo or you don’t want to deal with the tension anymore whenever the topic comes around, you start communicating as if the conflict isn’t there: “No, I am okay moving forward with this design.” Shortly after, you turn off your camera or have to go to the bathroom all of a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) sudden.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Arguing with yourself

At this point, we know the dysfunctional so well that we believe we can argue both sides all by ourselves—and we do. We play variations of the discussions we had before over and over in our head. We get ourselves worked up over a conflict that isn’t “active” at the moment because the person we’re having the conflict with is[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)n’t there.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Gossip

We try to reassure ourselves by gossiping with others that we’re on the right side. We’re looking for people that agree with us or trying to persuade people to join our side. This is our confirmation bias from chapter 6 at work. Gossiping can also be about creating the sides in a dysfunctional conflict. This can be a way to seek support f[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)rom others, which is normal human behavior that is needed in cultures. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Communication breaks down

Sometimes, we stop talking directly to the person altogether and start to ignore them. We solicit other people to do the work for us: “Maybe you can try talking to them and get the message through that th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ey are wrong!”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### What was the problem again?

Sometimes, dysfunctional conflicts last so long that nobody remembers what it was about originally. The dysfunctional conflicts lost all context, and most discussions aren’t about the original conflict anymore, which could have started as a functional conflict, but now everything about the other[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) person is wrong.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### -isms

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)In society, we have polarization and stereotyping, such as ageism, sexism, racism, and so on. We start seeing the other party in the conflict through those stereotypes: “They are just an ivo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ry tower architect!”[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### War or separation

Participation and collaboration have totally stopped, and everyone is exhausted. Other areas are starting to get affected by the dysfunctional conflict. There is only one solution, which is to go your own way. You quit your job, you get a divorce, you ask for a transfer to another department, or you stop being friends. But there is also some light in this phase: the original conflict is no longer taboo, and you can communicate openly about it again. It’s over anyway.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

These stages all sounds pretty bad, although we said conflict didn’t have to be negative. That is still true: as long as a conflict is visible, you don’t have too much to worry about. It might cause some tension and make people feel uncomfortable, but as long as it’s dealt with it eventually will resolve itself. Problems arise when a conflict is being suppressed or ignored. Two things are possible here. When people are avoiding a conflict, and start oppressing the emotions connected to that conflict, they will start showing edge behavior. When a conflict continues to go unresolved, they will start showing resistance. We’ll dig a bit deeper[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) into edge behavior first.

##### Exercise 8.1

Reflect on one of your personal recent conflicts. Remember, a conflict in its most basic form is a difference of opinion between two or more people. Which of the just-mentioned behaviors did you observe in ot[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)hers and within yourself? [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

### 8.1.2 Edge behavior

Conflict makes people really uncomfortable, so they try to avoid it. In psychology, this is referred to as *conflict avoidance*. When a person goes into conflict avoidant mode, they start showing edge behavior. *Edge behavior* means showing behavior that at first glance seems illogical and contradictory, just like the incongruence insight. A person exhibiting edge behavior wants to avoid a conflict because they don’t feel comfortable addressing it yet. Edge behavior lives on the border between consciousness and unconsciousness of an individual or group, which contradicts what is happening in the consciousness, as shown in figure 8.1.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

![Figure 8.1 Edge behavior happens when someone tries to oppress their inner shadows, but we can observe it because the unconscious behavior contradicts what we observe in the conscious behavior. As mentioned in chapter 5, when words and music don’t go together, they point to a missing element.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH08_F01_Baas.png)

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)To illustrate, edge behavior is also very visible with our furry cat friends. Maybe you recognize this: whenever cats are about to enter a fight, one of them might suddenly start grooming themself. This is also an example of edge behavior. It’s important to not judge this behavior. It’s very hard to sit in your own discomfort—trust us. We’ve been practicing for many years, but still go in[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)to edge behavior sometimes.

When people are on the edge, you’ll notice confusing communication and mixed signals. They will say one thing (“Everything is fine” or “I’m okay with the decision”), but exhibit contradicting behavior (not show up for a meeting). Confusing communication is a common behavioral pattern we observe during collaborative modeling. Part of the goal when modeling collaboratively is to get rid of ambiguity and confusing communication. This is why recognizing patterns of confusing communication is a useful skill. We’ll discuss a few of the most common communication patterns when people are on the edge. Note that these confusing communication patterns could happen in both remote and physical collaboration, and this lis[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)t isn’t complete nor finite.

#### Absence

Physically, people are present—they nod, they smile—but mentally they are absent. Their mind is somewhere else altogether, and they aren’t actively participating anymore in the disc[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ussions. They’ve checked out.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Interruption

People start interrupting each other more and more. They don’t allow for the other people in the room to finish sharing their thoughts or opinions. They aren’t really open to other perspectives. When observing, it’s interesting to see how and when the interruptions happen:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

-  Is it one person interrupting one other person in particular?
-  Is it happening on a specific topic?
-  Is it happening when someone expresses a minority opinion?

These observations will help you when addressing this behavior in the group because you can be [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)more specific when bringing it up.

#### Multiple monologues

Instead of having a dialogue, people are having monologues with each other. They just share their own opinion and aren’t actively listening to what other people have to say anymore. What they are saying isn’t an extension of what somebody already said or a question to get some clarification—they ar[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)e just talking next to each other.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Going off-topic

Another conflict avoidance communication pattern is to go off-topic completely. Often, the person in question is conscious that they are going off-topic and informs the group of it: “I know this isn’t related to what we’re talking about, but Mark’s question just made me think of this: Do we know *<insert different topic here>*.” In some cases, it’s not a problem if a group diverts or goes off-topic, but it’s important to notice when thi[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)s happens as an avoidance mechanism. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Questions that aren’t questions

Another way people show edge behavior through communication is by asking questions that aren’t questions. When somebody doesn’t feel comfortable outright stating their own opinion, they express it in the form of a question. There’s also judgment, assumptions, and direction hidden inside the question. Let’s clarify with an example from collaborative modeling. Imagine a group is doing EventStorming and trying to reach consensus on pivotal events. They are discussing which domain events could be good candidates. The follow conversation happens:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

P1: The event “Price was calculated” is a pivotal event for sure!

P2: Do you think it won’t cause a problem to take this domain event as a pivotal event?

P1: No, I don’t. I think it makes sense that this is a pivotal event.

P2: Are you sure it won’t be a problem?

P2 is asking a question that isn’t a question; instead, they are expressing their own opinion. They are seeing some problems with “Price was calculated” being a pivotal event, but they don’t feel comfortable stating that. It’s a disagreement hidden as a question: “I think it’s a problem to take this domain event as one of the pivotal events.” This person is asking these questions because they hope others agree with them and will come forward.

Note that asking questions that aren’t questions has more of an effect when it’s being done by someone with a higher ranking. Others will be more inclined to agree with the person asking because they are afraid to go a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)gainst the hidden opinion in the question.

#### Indirectness

Another way to express your own opinion without openly expressing it is indirectness. *Indirectness* during conversation can happen in three forms:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

-  Speaking in the third person when expressing your own opinion
-  Replacing a person or group with a more general term
-  The “guardian angel” bringing up a topic to be helpful to others

People express their opinion in the third person when they don’t feel comfortable openly stating their opinion. They will say things like “There are people here who don’t think this new architecture is the right way forward” instead of “I don’t think this new architecture is the right way forward.” Speaking in the third person gives them a safe feeling. If needed, they can still go back into avoidance and claim they aren’t part of that group of people.

The second form, replacing a person or group with a more general term, happens when people don’t feel comfortable putting a specific person or group on the spot, for example, “Someone made a mistake when filling in the meeting topics” or “A department requested more time, so now we’re running behind schedule.” This can easily backfire because the person or group being referred to in a general way knows this statement is about them. So, a person’s attempt to avoid conflict can actually trigger a bigger one.

The last form of indirect communication is the guardian angel. A person brings up a topic to be helpful: “I don’t have a problem with the new schedule, but some people might struggle with this.” It sounds like they are trying to be helpful, but it often has the opposite effect. If the people that are struggling with the new schedule due to the delays aren’t willing to speak up, you’re not helping them with trying to be their guardian angel. This form of indirectness isn’t easily distinguishable from the third person indirectness. It could be that this person is expressing their opinion in an indirect way, or they genuinely don’t have a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) problem with it and are trying to be helpful. The ambiguity created by indirectness reduces psychological safety within the group, as people grow anxious about who the conversation is about and how it might affect them.

#### Fallacious arguments

*Fallacious arguments* are logically unsound arguments, also known as fallacies. They are part of the cognitive biases and are specifically about faulty reasoning. From our experience, fallacies usually pop up when someone wants to achieve a certain goal, and the quality of reasoning is subordinate to this goal. Let’s look at a few examples to illustrate this better. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

*Ad hominem* (or *to the person*) is a fallacy that attacks a person’s characteristics instead of attacking their argument. Relevance is key here; ad hominem happens when the argument is irrelevant to the discussion in which it’s used. For example, when discussing bounded contexts during collaborative modeling, the new team member makes a suggestion, and another team member responds as follows: “It’s almost impossible for you to determine bounded contexts because you’ve never worked in an environment like this.” Never having worked in a similar environment is irrelevant to being able to come up with good suggestions on bounded contexts. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

A *straw man fallacy* means you take an argument of someone else, tailor and/or exaggerate it, and then argue against that distorted argument. Imagine this conversation at the end of a long EventStorming session:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

Rodney: I’m getting the feeling we’re really getting somewhere with this, but I’m not sure we picked the right boundaries. I think we should try to redraw them.

Kala: I don’t want to redo the whole exercise; that is a waste of everyone’s time! We should iterate on the boundaries that we already found.

Jack: Oh hell no, I completely agree with Kala; we shouldn’t redo the whole exercises. We should iterate on the boundaries.

Rodney: That is not what I said AT ALL!

Kala is arguing against “I want to redo the whole exercise,” not Rodney’s original statement: “I want to redraw the boundaries.” Because she is arguing against a distorted version, it’s starting to cause a conflict. Other ways somebody can make a straw man argument is oversimplifying a complex problem, arguing against a black-and-white version of your argument or taking your argument out of context.

Most people don’t consciously choose one of these confusing communication patterns. They don’t think “let me just ask a question that will derail the current conversation” or “let me use the third person in this question because I don’t want to have a direct conversation right now.” They are at the edge of the line between the conscious and unconscious. These are simply things that p[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)eople do or say when they want to avoid a conflict.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

### 8.1.3 What is resistance?

When people don’t feel listened to or feel that their opinion isn’t being taken into account, they will start showing *resistance* as a form of conflict that happens when someone doesn’t feel heard. Examples of resistance include someone starting to stare out the window whenever a specific topic is brought up during a meeting, or, in a remote setting, someone turning off their camera. This specific type of resistance is called *poor communication/breakdown*. There are other types of resistance. The Lewis Deep Democracy methodology[4](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-003) refers to the types of resistance somebody can exhibit as *the terrorist line*. In later works based on that of Myrna Lewis, this is called the *resistance line*.[5](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-002)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

The resistance line (figure 8.2) shows the most common stages of resistance that people go through when they feel they aren’t being heard or their opinion isn’t being valued when making group decisions. This might be seen as immature or childish, but nothing is further from the truth. Resistance is a normal behavior; everyone does it—yes, you too! People can either resist as a group, which is most of the time [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)the minority group in Deep Democracy, or as an individual. As facilitators, our goal is to observe and identify coherent patterns along the line of resistance—whether they relate to the session itself or broader tensions within the company. A sarcastic joke, for instance, doesn’t necessarily disrupt the group’s dynamics.

![Figure 8.2 The resistance line. The further down the line the minority group goes, the less efficient the group will be able to function.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH08_F02_Baas.png)

#### Sarcastic Jokes

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)Jokes or sarcasm is one of the most common ways to express resistance. At first glance, they may seem very innocent but they interrupt and can make a group lose track of the conversation. Detecting whether the jokes and the sarcasm are expressing resistance isn’t always easy. This heavily depends on the cul[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)tural circumstances, which a facilitator should be aware of.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Excuses

Everyone has heard the following at some point in their life: “I didn’t do that yet. I was about to do it, but then something more important came up, so I had to do it first.” The “just about to do it” excuse is one of the most common. Making excuses for why you’re not following the decision that has been made is another form of resistance. Excuses are difficult to deal with because there often is a piece of truth in them. It could very well be that something more urgent came up for that[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) person. If excuses keep popping up, that can cause a problem.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Gossiping

Another form of resistance is to start gossiping about a decision that has been made. The interesting thing about this form of resistance is that the person is expressing their opinion openly at this time. So, gossip also can be a good way to det[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ect how people really feel about a decision that has been made.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Poor communication/breakdown

Stopping or limiting communication is the next type of resistance: “If they don’t want to listen to me, then I’m not going to talk!” This can be dangerous because without proper c[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ommunication, a group will start functioning more inefficiently.

#### Disruption

Once communication starts to go poorly, the resistance toward the decision or the decision makers starts to be more open. People start talking among themselves during meetings, or put up obvious roadblocks, such as having to make an offic[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ial request with the department head to be able to move forward.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Go slow

Slowing down creates an even bigger inefficiency in a team or department. In this context, slowing down means slowing down the execution of a decision. Agenda items being pushed to the next meeting, requesting extra information[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/), and so on are examples of slowing down as a form of resistance.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Strike

When people still don’t feel heard, they will stop participating completely. This can be individually, such as not taking part in team building days or office parties, or as [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)a group when the entire department decides to put down their work.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### War/withdrawal

War or withdrawal is the last stage of the resistance line. The minority group resists by withdrawing from the majority group. This can be either physical or mental withdrawal. Another option in the last stage is war, where the minority group decides to go to battle against the majority. War can also take either a mental form or a physical form in the same cases. This might seem far-fetched, but it isn’t. We’ve all seen strikes on television that turned violent,[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) erupting into a physical attack because the crowd became so angry.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### Exercise 8.2

Think back on a few moments where you showed resistance toward a decision that had been made. What type of behavior(s) did you exhibit during those moments? Add them to the resistance line, as shown in figure 8.3. If you’d like, you could also think of the behaviors of others that you observed when yo[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)u noticed resistance toward a decision. Do you see patterns there?

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)The further down the line we get, the more inefficient a group will become due to this behavior. Making a joke or even responding sarcastically is still a very subtle way to show resistance. It might make a few people uncomfortable, but it doesn’t bring the efficiency of a group that much down. Once you go into disruption or war, a group can’t function effectively anymore.

As a facilitator, it’s important to observe the group to detect this type of behavior and bring the conflicts that are causing it out of the shadows and into the group where they can be discussed and resolved. In the next sections, we’ll give you examples of edge behavior and resistance, show the consequences they have on your software design, an[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)d teach you some techniques for dealing with these types of behavior.

![Figure 8.3 An example of exercise 8.2. The authors added their favorite go-to behavior when showing resistance.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH08_F03_Baas.png)

## 8.2 Resistance and conflict during collaboration

Collaborative modeling is a great place for resistance and conflict. We put people together in a room, and we hope they will collaborate, create a shared (mental) model, and agree on the best possible solution. This isn’t always the case. People will disagree about the bounded contexts that are proposed, pivotal events that are chosen, the value of proposed solutions and parts of the model, social hierarchy, and speed of progression—just to name a few. To make it even more difficult, there will be a multitude of mental models flying around during collaborative modeling. We want to bring these together and create a shared, unambiguous model, but this is way harder than you might expect. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

As stated in section 8.1, resistance and conflict are often considered negative concepts that should be avoided whenever possible. The truth is, resistance and conflict can tell us a lot about a group and its social dynamics. They can point us to the topics that are at the root cause of any hindrance we might encounter. Because resistance is inevitable, we need to learn to expect it, make it a part of the flow, and normalize it. As a facilitator, this is one of your key responsibilities during collaborative modeling.

Earlier in this book, we talked about other social dynamics, including cognitive bias and ranking. Resistance and conflict are related to these concepts, and they can strengthen and/or reinforce each other. For example, when a person with a high rank drops an anchor on a pivotal event or bounded context, this might lead to conflict. Due to ranking, the concerns or counterarguments might not be made explicit, resulting in people completely zoning out as a form of resistance. This might affect your software design because you’re missing out on possible relevant input and perspectives.

Note that the concepts of resistance and conflict are extremely complex and are often used as container concepts. We very often see groups trying to oversimplify these concepts of resistance and conflict by using them as one big umbrella to categorize a lot of behavior, interpretations, and assumptions. For example, we might interpret someone who’s not moving a lot of stickies around as disengaged or in resistant mode. However, this person might be creating a mental model by absorbing everything around them and taking some time to organize all those observations before speaking up and moving stickies around.

In this section, we’ll dive into what resistance and conflict could look like in collaborative modeling, nuancing the two concepts so you can properly recognize them and approach them as learning opportunities. We’ll also[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) cover the effect of resistance and conflict on your software design.

### 8.2.1 Recognizing resistance and conflict in collaborative modeling

Collaborative modeling is a place where resistance and any sort of conflict are bound to happen. As mentioned earlier, these two concepts can be used as umbrella or container concepts. You should be careful with using these container concepts like resistance and conflict. Try to avoid assumptions and interpretations. Just observe behavior and patterns. In the following subsections, we’ll describe some examples of behavioral and communication patterns that could indicate resistance and/or conflict during collaborative modeling.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

During collaborative modeling, there are different behavioral patterns that could indicate the presence of conflict and/or resistance. For the record, *behavior* for us means someone doing something or saying something that we can observe. We consider behavior to be a pattern when we can observe it three times in an objective manner. Remember how we talked about core competencies of a facilitator in chapter 5? Neutrality and observation competencies ar[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)e very useful when trying to recognize (hidden) conflict or resistance.

#### Recognizing edge behavior during collaborative modeling

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)At BigScreen, there had been many discussions on the new software design between stakeholders. We can only support that because, in most cases, it leads to better solutions. In one discussion though, we observed edge behavior from one developer (Jack) in particular. In a discussion with Rose about the design, we noticed how he checked out after a while. He was still nodding and humming along with the conversation, but he wasn’t actively contributing anymore by suggesting ideas and options. Before this checking out happened, we observed Jack interrupting Rose a lot and only focusing on his own ideas and suggestions. Almost every time Rose suggested something, Jack interrupted her and asked questions like, “Wouldn’t it be better if we . . . ,” “Do you believe that . . . ?” We identified this as edge behavior: Jack was interrupting, asking questions that weren’t questions (see section 8.1.2), and eventually became absent.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

With the developments over the past few years, we’ve been working together online more and more. As we discussed in chapter 5, remote facilitation makes certain things more difficult, including observing behavioral patterns. You have to observe through a small camera window, which makes it easier to miss subtle behavior. In some cases, though, edge behavior in remote collaboration is rather obvious.

At BigScreen, we had a combination of in-person and remote sessions. During one of those remote sessions, we were going over some design decisions with the development team. A couple of these decisions were leading up to heated discussions, and we could already observe some edge behavior: developers interrupting each other all the time, the team lead going off-topic, and ongoing monologues. At one point, we as facilitators started to notice that whenever the discussion focused on one design decision in particular, the architect, Rodney, turned off his camera. It happened once, it happened twice, and when it happened the third time, we felt the need to deal with it. This was clear edge behavior, specifically absence, by literally becoming invisible when a certain topic popped up. We noticed the rest of the group getting frustrated with Rodney’s behavior and starting to[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) show some resistance by making sarcastic jokes and causing disruptions.

#### Recognizing the stages of a conflict

A conflict is a great learning point and can be very fruitful. The longer a conflict is ignored, the harder it is to fix it, and requires us to return through all the stages of conflict we’ve been in. In the beginning of our careers, we found a company that advertised Domain-Driven Design, collaborative modeling, and the whole shebang. Obviously, we submitted our resumes and we were overjoyed when we heard we got the job. Unfortunately, we started working in an IT department that was in a highly dysfunctional conflict. During lunch, during coffee breaks, and after meetings, the same thing was always discussed: how bad the product owner was, how they just didn’t get it, and how they lost touch with modern techno[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)logy. Everything they did was wrong, and the development team was right.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

You know when a conflict turns dysfunctional when dialogues or discussions move toward the notion of right or wrong. As a facilitator, this is your cue to start resolving the conflict.

That person just could not do anything good anymore. The original conflict that started it all was long forgotten. This was a clear case of “What was the problem again?” Back then, we didn’t have the skills yet that we have now. We tried to talk to the product owner, but because the conflict had reached a stage where it became invisible, they just thought we were the ones with the problem. There was no one there who could help fix what was broken between the product owner and the team. It was a toxic environment to work in, and eventually we decided to find a new job—we were ready to withdraw. Sometimes a conflict is beyond repair. It’s important to try and get a grasp of where a conflict is, who it is between, and how far along it is. Don’t bang your head against a wall trying to fix something that has [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)been going on for too long to find a good resolution. Trust us, it hurts.

#### Recognizing resistance in collaborative modeling

A few clients back, we were contacted to organize an EventStorming session. As external facilitators, we don’t always know what happened before we arrived. This was one of those times where the important information didn’t come up during our interviews, but smacked us in the face 2 hours into our first session. One of our participants started yelling at the organizer:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

*This is the fifth session we’re talking about this nonsense, and nothing EVER comes from it! This is going to be more of the same, and I am sick and tired of it. It’s your fault, you just don’t listen and want us to blindly approve your solution. You say no to every suggestion I make without giving an explanation as to why it’s not a good solution. You’re just completely ignoring me, and I have had it*!

After that, they turned around and stormed out of the room. It was very clear to us that this person had just gone on a strike, which didn’t change the fact that we lost control of the session.

This is just another way to say that no matter how much experience you have at collaborative modeling or dealing with the social dynamics of a group, once in a while, it just goes wrong. A lot of people come to us thinking collaborative modeling is the answer to their problem and that it’s a tool to realize breakthroughs and get consensus. It’s true, you can have amazing breakthroughs with collaborative modeling that lead to better design decisions, but that can only happen if we manage and start resolving th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)e conflicts. If we ignore conflicts, this will lead to even worse designs.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

### 8.2.2 The effect of resistance and conflict on software design

Because we’re focusing on software design decisions in this book, it might be worthwhile to zoom in a bit on how conflict and resistance affect that specifically. Conflict and resistance that aren’t managed properly won’t lead to the best model for your business problems. To get to the best models and solutions, we need a shared mental model instead of multiple, different mental models built into the same software. With collaborative modeling, we aim to create this shared mental model that will be the foundation for the software design. If conflict gets in the way and holds people back from sharing information, listening to each other, and accepting other suggestions and solutions, we’ll get to less contextual solutions with probably a lot of language ambiguity.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

Talking about language, poor communication can also have a serious negative effect on your software design. Imagine our BigScreen architect Rodney in a collaborative modeling session talking in an indirect way all the time:

-  “So, we can all agree these are the most logical boundaries, right?”
-  “The group seems to agree on the bounded context.”
-  “Everyone here understands what we mean with customers.”

The session ends, and Rodney is optimistic and assumes everyone is on the same page. No bad intentions whatsoever. Fast-forward to implementation, and then conflict starts to arise. Developers going against design decisions, not agreeing with boundaries, and a lot of language ambiguity. Rodney’s first reaction is, “But I thought everyone was on board with this.” The conflict that started during implementation is a consequence of the poor communication during the collaborative modeling. The assumptions made there are now part of the software design, and they didn’t make it better. If this had been resolved during the session itself by making assumptions explicit and asking the right (counter)questions, it would not have led to conflict during implementation.

Another possible consequence of this confusing communication is people not taking ownership. We know this is an abstract and broad concept, but we focus on people feeling responsible for the solution in this part. When indirectness is being used, or people talk in the third person, it might lead to feeling less responsible for the eventual solution. This, in turn, is related to the *not invented here syndrome*, which means that people tend to feel more certain about the usefulness and importance of something when they created it themself, than similar ideas, suggestions, or solutions that others came up with. This syndrome also leads to the tendency to avoid using solutions, ideas, models, or knowledge from external origins. People seem to have a strong bias against ideas from others or the outside. This also means we’re less likely to accept or adopt an idea or solution that comes from somewhere that feels like “the outside.” Let’s take it back to the collaborative modeling session example: if there is a lot of indirectness, talking in the third person, and not being able to personally get acquainted with the model or solution, people will be less likely to feel responsible for it. That will affect your software design in a negative manner. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

With the risk of repeating ourselves, conflict and resistance aren’t necessarily bad things. A difference of opinion can be classified as a task-based or functional conflict, and the same goes for a language ambiguity discussion. Yes, if they aren’t being managed properly, they will heavily affect your software design in a negative way, which is why having someone observing and facilitating them is crucial. Now, l[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)et’s dive into some practical guidance on how to do this in the next section.

### 8.2.3 Resistance and conflict as learning opportunities

How we deal with and resolve resistance and conflict are what determines their effect. We can learn from conflict and resistance because they tell us something about the group, their shadows, and their potential demons. Knowing this and making them explicit so we can resolve them can prevent disasters from happening. So, instead of seeing conflict and resistance as something we need to avoid, let’s see where the learning opportunities are. From our experience, we’ll describe a few learning opportunities we think are highly valuable.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

First, conflict and resistance behavior is an opportunity to create mutual understanding. We can observe behavior that might be classified as resistant or conflict-causing. We often ask ourselves this question: “Why is someone doing that or saying that?” Usually, people show behavior because there is a positive consequence related to that behavior for them. So, apparently, by showing resistant behavior or arguing, a positive consequence is following for the person showing the behavior. Finding out what that is can be very helpful. For example: you observe a lot of gossiping going on during lunch breaks. The same people seem to be involved, and the topics are recurring as well. By gossiping about certain things, processes, or people, this person might get a form of attention they strive for. Maybe it gives them the feeling of being heard and being able to get on “a stage” and spread their own ideas. Or maybe it provides them with a higher informal rank because more and more people are going along with the gossiping behavior. Whatever it is, the behavior is yielding positive consequences for the person showing that behavior. A facilitator can help figure out what those consequences are and thereby interpret the resistant behavior. This is a huge learning opportunity for the group, and it can result in having better outcomes by flash-lighting the shadows and making them smaller.

Second, conflicts make different perspectives and opposing sides visible and explicit. This might not sound like a learning opportunity right away, but by making those explicit, a group gets the chance to counter functional fixedness for example. To illustrate, if one part of the group feels things need to speed up, and another part feels things need to slow down, it might feel like a highly challenging problem. What are you going to do as a facilitator: slow down or speed up? In fact, this is what we call a *polarity*: two sides of the same coin that affect and need each other. You don’t solve this polarity by choosing A or B, but you manage it by going back and forth. Chances are, you encounter a lot of these polarities that are often mistaken for conflicts. In chapter 10, we’ll dive into these polarities and how to manage them. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

Note that facilitators have a great effect on and role in seizing these learning opportunities. Section 8.3 will dive further into th[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)is and provide you with tools and techniques to manage conflict and resistance. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

## 8.3 Facilitating toward a resolution

Let’s dive into how we can resolve resistance and conflicts with a software design EventStorming session we facilitated at BigScreen. Let’s first reflect and remember the importance of the observer role as a facilitator. The goal of facilitation is to make it easier for people to collaborate and participate in their own way.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

One crucial skill for resolving resistance and conflict is having good observation skills. We recommend practicing observing patterns in groups. When you do, think about how you felt when someone didn’t speak much during a session and when they spoke up again later. Consider what you experienced when someone raised their voice and dominated the conversation, causing the room to fall silent. These are all important observations to make as a facilitator. Because of your inne[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)r conflict, those emotions as shadows can heavily influence the social dynamics of the group.

### 8.3.1 Resistance and conflict in practice

Have you ever found yourself assuming something about a situation or person, only to later realize that your assumptions were influenced by your own biases? As we explain in the previous chapter, it’s a natural tendency, but failing to recognize these biases in ourselves while noticing them in others is what we call the *bias blind spot*. And if we’re not aware of these blind spots, they may lead to conflicts which can turn into shadows and demons that entangle themselv[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)es with the group that we’re supposed to facilitate, as depicted in figure 8.4.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

![Figure 8.4 An example of how our bias blind spot can lead to shadows and demons getting entangled with the group in a software design EventStorming session at BigScreen. Not being aware of how your own bias interplays with that of the group might lower your effectiveness as a facilitator.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH08_F04_Baas.png)

As humans, we all have different perspectives and opinions. This is a good thing—it opens up opportunities for learning and growth. But sometimes, holding a strong opinion on a particular topic can become a problem, especially when we’re facilitating discussions. For instance, we strongly believe that Kubernetes isn’t useful in most situations. That can result in quickly labeling others’ opinions as wrong and our own as right. And it’s a short step to falling into a confirmation bias by finding the cons. This can be problematic when someone is expressing a different viewpoint, as it can cause us to lose sight of our rol[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)e as facilitators and the need to create an open and respectful dialogue or debate.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Frame discussions or disagreements as a dialogue or debate. People have a mental model of what a dialogue or debate is compared to a discussion or disagreement, and it will focus on ideas instead of personal conflict.[6](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-001)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

In fact, labeling things as “right” or “wrong” can reinforce that confirmation bias. This can cause us to become even more entrenched in our own opinions, while the other person may do the same. The problem isn’t about labeling something as right or wrong—it’s about being aware of our biases and avoiding falling into this pattern of biased thinking. By staying mindful of our own biases and remaining open to different perspectives, [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)we can create a more collaborative and productive environment for everyone involved.

#### Understanding your inner conflicts and how they might affect your facilitation

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)Getting caught up in a conflict or tension because of someone else’s opinion is a common experience that can turn into inner conflicts which creates shadows. It will distract us from our goal of supporting the group effectively. When our inner conflicts and judgments come into play, we may act out in negative ways. Maybe we start with making some sarcastic jokes about Kubernetes, or start lobbying against it during the break. Or maybe we’ve interrupted or shut down someone who was expressing a different viewpoint. That’s not very helpful behavior as a facilitator, right? But it’s all too normal to do if you’re holding strong opinions, which, if we’re fair, most of us have in IT.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

As facilitators, it’s important to be aware of our own behavior and how it can affect the group. When we’re not behaving in a neutral way, our biases and negative emotions can hinder our ability to create a productive and respectful environment. We might show resistance or use confusing communication to get our point across, further breaking down communication and creating more dysfunctional conflict. Even worse, we might go slow and start using confusing communication and asking questions that aren’t really questions, such as “Are you sure that it’s a good idea?” Think about it for a second, did you do those in the past? We certainly did! It’s easy to get caught up in conflict or even start one as a facilitator. But change can only happen if we acknowledge and address our own behavior. It can all start by a[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)cknowledging the behavior of the resistance line and the conflict stages in yourself.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Investigate and reflect on the strong opinions you’re holding. What you think is wrong to do might make you lose your neutrality and keep you from facilitating the group the best way possible.

We created more resistance and tension in the group by showing edge behavior, which also causes conflict, as mentioned earlier. This has lowered our own rank in the group, and it’s difficult to regain it. This is why it’s important to do inner reflective work and be aware of our behavior and the shadows within us. We know that distancing yourself from certain viewpoints is very hard to do, especially in a leadership role such as an architect, tech lead, consultant, or product owner. Having both the role of facilitator and a leadership role can cause a paradox. On one side, you want to stay neutral as a facilitator, guiding the group to make a decision. On the other side, people expect you to also make decisions. Expressing opinions and taking autocratic decisions may cause resistance and conflict, and that creates a tension that leads to conflict and eventually can end up triggering the resistance line. That is one of the hardest parts of facilitation—managing that paradox. Again, you can resolve that paradox by reflecting on your own resistant and conflict behavior, the shadows that are inside, you and the biases you have. Don’t turn a blind eye to those![](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### Exercise 8.3

Write down the three strongest opinions you’re holding. Reflect on each of them:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

-  What happened to make this such a strong opinion?
-  How do you feel when someone has an opposite opinion?
-  What emotion/behavior does it trigger after someone challenges that[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) opinion?

These exercises help you prepare for your next facilitation to stay neutral.

#### Understanding the group conflicts

We mentioned before how important our observation skills are that we introduced in chapter 5. They are especially useful if we want to understand the group conflicts to help resolve them. In one of the exercises, we asked you to write down some patterns you observed during your meetings. These can include observed behavior you see people repeating or certain words people kept repeating. Some of these patterns can create tension, for instance, patterns that are on the resistance line and confusing communication patterns. Although not all patterns need to lead to escalation of a conflict, we need to be mindful of those that do, that is, the ones that show edge behavior. These are shadows in the group wanting to come out in the open, and people always have the tendency to move away and to suppress the shadows. If we’re not facilitating the group to deal with the shadows of the group, they will turn into demons and show themselves. To help the group deal with these shadows, we must first become aware of the shadows in the group. But sometimes, a conflict has already gone too far, so before intervening in a conflict, it’s important to understand the stage it’s at. Let’s see how that works in action![](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

In section 8.2, we explained what can happen if we don’t understand the group conflicts. When we engaged with BigScreen we decided to do things differently. In our preliminary conversation with Meera, the CTO, we already noticed that there were a lot of dysfunctional conflicts going on. When she started walking us through their problems, she told us about their agile transformation and that the architect left. When we asked her about why she didn’t hire another one for a couple of years, she told us about the misconception of no up-front design in agile and how that led to a conflict between two of the developers, Rose and Jack. This conflict prevented her from hiring another architect for a while because she was under the assumption the team would manage architecture.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)That information led us to the decision we wrote about in chapter 6 to start joining the team sessions, including dailies, refinements, retrospectives, and other operational meetings the teams had at the start of the engagement, and to observe. We saw a lot of communication breakdowns. Jack and Rose almost never interacted in these sessions; they never had a dialogue, as in listening to each other and reacting to what the other said. Although they were listening, it wasn’t to understand one another but to be able to dispute the other’s argument. A lot of fallacious arguments were going back and forth about the person, not about the topic itself. It’s important to notice that we didn’t intervene or facilitate the sessions here because we could lose trust with any of the parties. Another important observation is that the rest of the group mostly stayed silent and did what was asked.

What we also observed was that Jack and Rose used a lot of stereotyped words, such as ivory-tower architect, and used absolutes in sentences like “She always does . . . .” But we got a different vibe from the other developers on the team. In the team sessions we joined, they were mostly quiet, but in the interviews, most of them started to open up. That gave us a lot of information about the shadows in the group. Almost every time there’s a conflict between two people, others are inevitably affected. A conflict is never isolated; it’s always part of the group dynamic. That’s why we aim to probe neutrally, using active listening to understand how others feel about the situation. The topic of the conflict was the software design, how that was decided, and the reason for the architect leaving. It was a topic that came back in every consecutive interview. In those interviews, we could probe more and see what information was in the group conscious and unconscious. And we could hypothesize about which information is important to bring up during our collaborative modeling sessions. These patterns we observed and then reflected on drove the design of the check-ins and sensemaking.

Doing consecutive interviews also helped to start resolving the conflict. Just using active listening and letting someone be heard already begins resolving the conflict. They probably never felt understood or safe to express how they felt. Most of the time, people jump to conclusions by trying to fix someone. Telling them they are making assumptions and perhaps they are wrong. But in these interviews, we like to focus on what they have to say and that it’s allowed to be said. That already takes a lot of pressure off the conflict. In our case, it did, and the conflict didn’t escalate too far for us to save it from separation. We saw small changes happening, especially with Jack and Rose. They didn’t col[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)laborate yet with each other, but the language they were using was already toned down.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Use an interview to understand a conflict. During interviews, check the behavior people show, and plot these on the conflict stages to get a grasp of what kind of intervention is necessary.

For the kickoff session, we didn’t need to solve the conflict straight away, as those sessions are focused on getting an understanding of the current situation. Of course, if they would stand in the way of progress, we would need to deal with some of it. But because we weren’t designing and coming with solutions in the kickoff, we also didn’t need to dive into the conflict yet. But we already nudged the group in those kickoff sessions toward starting to resolve the conflict, as we focused on letting everyone be heard, as explained in chapter 6. Getting all these different perceptions in the group conscious already helped Jack and Rose understand other people’s perspectives. But once we went into the software design EventStor[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ming in one of the follow-up sessions, we needed to start resolving the group conflict.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

### 8.3.2 Kissing the group over the edge

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)Because the previous kickoff and follow-up sessions created positive vibes in collaboration with the team, we decided not to do what we call a *hot check-in*. A hot check-in instantly dives into the conflict, for instance, asking the group what the quality of the current design or architecture is or how valuable they think an architect would be for the team. That could put the group straight back into a pressure cooker and might push the conflict back to the -*isms through polarization* or, even worse, to the *war or separation* conflict stage. What we did instead is focus on what everyone’s need was as we observed it from previous sessions. When there is a polarization happening, it’s best not to put extra fuel on each side, but to find what the people in the middle, or as Bart Bransdma calls “the silent,”[7](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/footnote-000) want. He calls these people the silent because they are stuck in the middle, not being heard in the polarizing conflict, and eventually are forced to choose a side. In our case, we focused on better understanding the business problems, so we kept it light and did an impromptu networking with three rounds as a check-in, as introduced in chapter 4. We told people to interact with each other using the following prompts as nudges:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

1.  Tell the other person an anecdote of a reservation you made in your personal life that is funny or weird.
1.  What part of the reservation flow are you involved in?
1.  What are some funny, good, or bad events that you saw happening in the current flow?

As always with a check-in, we introduced how the impromptu works, and we shared an anecdote on the first question as an example. Then, we asked them to preferably do the impromptu with someone they knew the least. Essentially, we told them at the end, we’ll ask people what they heard from someone else, instead of what they have to say.

Explaining what you hear from someone else makes people more focused on listening to understand instead of reacting. That is an important job for us as facilitators, to nudge people to start understanding instead of reacting, and an impromptu can help start that off and change that behavior unconsciously. Another thing an impromptu does is that people can find someone safe enough to engage with. When there is tension in the group, it can be unsafe for people to speak up in the group. With an impromptu, they can find someone in the group they feel safe with to start engaging with the topic. It also gives us some time to observe, see who will talk with whom and especially who avoids whom. There are always people who feel safe enough to start a conversation with a person they don’t know yet.

Another effect is that people need to start moving around the room, which gets them activated. One thing to understand is that if groups and people are stuck in conflict or resistant to change, you often see this reflected in their body movements as well. They will literally stand still and not move. If you want to make the conversation flow, it can help to also let the people [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)move physically. After the impromptu, we invite people to share what they heard from others.

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When groups are stuck in a conversation, let the group move physically in an exercise. Movement trumps sitting, and it can help to unblock the flow of the conversation.

We could now start the modeling with tools stage with software design EventStorming. Because the group had a total of 18 people, we decided to split it into two groups. We let people divide themselves with one rule, that the team is equally divided among domain knowledge. We had two reasons for doing it this way. First, smaller modeling groups go faster. Because there are fewer people with divergent models, everyone gets enough air time in the group to get the opportunity to be involved. Second, that gives people the opportunity to join a group they feel safest to share in. The only danger here is that we must be careful that the groups aren’t focusing and putting extra fire on the polarization, instead of focusing on equally sharing the models in that group.

That is why at the start of the session, we always discuss some safety rules, or agreements. One we use all the time comes from the Lewis Deep Democracy methodology: no one holds the monopoly on the truth. We ask the participants if they agree and understand that before we start the session. That agreement can help us later on, when the group shows a pattern of not complying with those rules. We were with two people to facilitate the session, so we divided ourselves between the groups.

Now we need to stay in contact with ourselves, reflect on our own tensions and edge behavior and our inner shadows, and continuously work on our neutrality. Not losing your neutrality is inescapable because judgments and assumptions are so easily made (and also really fulfilling sometimes, we know!). Through staying in contact with ourselves, we can observe the patterns that are happening in the group, spot resistance, and sense where the *hotspots* are. In Arnold Mindell’s *Sitting in the Fire* book, he described hotspots as emotionally charged situations, problems, or moments during a conflict in a group setting. These hotspots are seen as opportunities rather than problems because they indicate where we should focus our attention. Diving into these hotspots is an opportunity to lower the waterline, and they often lead to profound understanding and resolution for the group.

From here we can let the group become aware of the edge, that is, pull the edge to the conscious part of the group by “kissing the group over the edge,” as Myrna Lewis says. This is a metaphor for our desire to guide the group gently beyond their comfort zone to confront and work through their difficult problems, conflicts, or tensions. Throwing a group over the edge and pressuring the group beyond their comfort zone, isn’t a good idea. It can cause stress and anxiety, as well as damage relationships. This tactic can even lead to a burnout or cause a group to fracture beyond repair. Pushing the group usually is the effective with people of lower rank. One of our [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)favorite facilitation techniques for kissing groups over the edge is called a climate report.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Climate reports

A *climate report* is a series of steps that you take as a facilitator to gently confront the group with a hotspot, as follows:[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

-  Make neutral, factual observations.
-  Offer these observations as feedback to the group. Use their words, not your own, to do this. Be aware that presenting a climate report is a judgment on your part as facilitator, as you believe the observed pattern may hinder the group’s progress or obstruct the session’s information flow.
-  Stay quiet and let the group address your feedback. It’s crucial to understand that, as facilitators, we don’t decide whether something is dysfunctional; that responsibility lies with the group.

We applied this technique after we split the group into two teams of nine. Both teams began in the typical fashion, with each team generating domain events individually before progressing to the timeline enforcement phase. Some teams might begin enforcing the timeline during the chaotic exploration stage, which is acceptable as long as the remainder of the team can still contribute. It’s crucial to ensure that higher-ranking individuals don’t dominate the conversation, leaving little room for those in lower ranks to participate. This is precisely what occurred in both teams by Jack and Rose, along with Susan, Bruce, Hadiza, and Dmytro. We observed the following: before the rest of the group could finish writing down their domain events, they had already started enforcing the timeline, engaging in active discussions about their domain events and their sequence. While enthusiasm isn’t inherently negative, it was apparent that some members were still working on their domain events, and others appeared somewhat confused about the situation and their next steps.

We had explicitly instructed the group to allow everyone the opportunity to write down all events they could think of and place them on the paper roll before proceeding to the timeline enforcement phase, so it was understandable that confusion arose. This pattern isn’t unique to our BigScreen context, as it occurs in almost every EventStorming session we conduct. Multiple people looking up and ceasing their writing can be perceived as edge behavior, indicating that tension is building. It’s essential to address this tension early, but we must exercise caution in our approach, as it can significantly affect our neutrality and standing within the group.

We opted to use the climate report as a gentle nudge for the group to assess whether they can identify with our observations. Determining when to introduce a climate report is a bit tricky. If they aren’t ready for it, we risk losing our neutrality and, consequently, our ranking within the group. We want to be sure the group is ready to recognize the problem as an impediment and that they are prepared to accept it. However, if we delay too much, the shadows beneath the edge may transform into a demon, resulting in more significant conflict and necessitating additional time for conflict resolution. Fun, isn’t it, to be dealing with that uncertainty? We’ve been on both sides and learned it the hard way as well!

In the situation involving Jack, Rose, Susan, Bruce, Hadiza, and Dmytro, who began enforcing the timeline before the others had finished, we provided the following climate report to the group: “I notice some of you have already started enforcing the timeline, while others in the group are still in the process of writing.” As you can see, everything mentioned is factual, allowing the group to reflect and decide on their next course of action. It’s crucial to present a climate report addressing a pattern relevant to the entire group, rather than one or two individuals. Directing a climate report on specific individuals puts them in the spotlight, potentially making them feel unsafe. Feeling unsafe can lead to decreased participation or withdrawal from the group by those individuals. While some individuals may thrive in the spotlight, they typically already assume that position. The objective is to extract [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)knowledge and wisdom from the entire group, and we want to avoid alienating individual members.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Address feedback and concerns to the entire group; avoid putting a spotlight on one or two individuals, especially when they are low in ranking.

In many sessions, individuals with higher rank tend to dominate the conversation, often overshadowing others. We refer to this as the *karaoke player pattern*, where someone takes charge and dictates the group’s direction. At this point, we have two options, depending on our own rank. If we have the ranking to address the problem, we should do so. Because karaoke speakers have already placed themselves in the spotlight, it’s acceptable, for the group’s benefit, to comment on their behavior or encourage input from other group members. This may result in a conflict between you and the karaoke speaker, but it’s part of the job and allows for conflict resolution. We can play our rank to share our rank with the rest of the group, as discussed in chapter 6.

However, there may be instances where the karaoke speaker is the one who hired you, possibly without you realizing the specific purpose. They might simply require you to facilitate the group in understanding and adopting their perspective. In situations like these, it can be challenging to address the problem during the session, as you may be overruled. Instead, discuss the matter with the individual afterward, ensuring the session remains safe and constructive for all participants as much as possible.

##### Note

Addressing the group, not the individual is a core principle in our facilitation approach. Our goal is to create a safe space where everyone can collaborate in the most effective manner for them. This is why we don’t assign turns during check-ins, as we want participants to feel at ease and freely express their thoughts. If we spotlight someone who isn’t prepared, they may only share what is socially acceptable or considered safe within the group, rather than their genuine thoughts and beliefs, which require courage and a safe environment. When facilitating a workshop or providing training, consider the type of feedback or information you seek from the group. If your goal is to uncover participants’ true thoughts, allow them the room to express themselves when they feel comfortable doing so. Facilitators play a vital role in fostering this environment.

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)When presenting a climate report, it’s crucial to capture the full attention of the group to facilitate reflection on the information being shared. After speaking, we remain silent and observe the group’s reaction. Instead of drawing conclusions ourselves, we patiently wait for a group member to break the silence. Before proceeding, we must confirm that the group can relate to and accept the climate report. If the group remains silent for an extended period, we can seek confirmation by asking, “Does what I just said resonate with you?” We should refrain from proposing a solution until the group’s feedback indicates acceptance.

In most instances, the group will find a solution to the problem on their own, as occurred in this scenario. The members who had already begun enforcing the timeline opted to fetch drinks for everyone while waiting for the others to finish. This allowed them to discuss the events without ignoring their enthusiasm and without disrupting the rest of the group. Everyone concurred, and our sole responsibility was to assist them in discovering their solution. We also suggested taking an additional 5-minute break for those who were still[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) writing once everyone had finished. With everyone in agreement, we continued with the session.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### Exercise 8.4

Think about a situation where you could have presented a climate report to the group or a situation in which another facilitator could have done this. De[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)scribe the situation, and create the climate report that could have been presented to the group. [](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Addressing the conflict

You might be thinking that conflict was an easy one to solve, and you’re right. Let’s now explore a situation where the group struggles with longer unresolved conflicts, resulting in edge behavior. During our session, we observed that Rose and Jack joined separate groups, which wasn’t unexpected. The problem emerged after 40 minutes of enforcing the timeline when both groups reached the portion of the EventStorming that dealt with the central disagreement between Jack and Rose. They both began to push their agendas within their respective groups, attempting to persuade others to support their side.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

Unintentionally using their rank, Jack and Rose started dominating the conversation, leaving less speaking time for other developers and leading to a breakdown in communication. Both Jack and Rose displayed a considerable amount of confirmation bias, which is common in conflicts that revolve around determining right and wrong. As a consequence, the remaining developers, feeling unheard in their own group, started eavesdropping on the other group’s conversations. This edge behavior emerged in both groups.

We provided both groups with the following climate report: “We’ve observed that some individuals are speaking more than others in each group, and we also noticed people from one group eavesdropping on the other group’s discussions.” After presenting the climate report, we remained silent and observed the group’s reactions, looking for signs of acknowledgment or acceptance. When approximately 1 minute had passed without any response, we broke the silence and used our active listening skills by asking if anyone could relate to our observations or had a different perspective.

Jack took the initiative to defend himself, rejecting the feedback and arguing that he contributed more because the other developers weren’t engaging. This response not only worsened the conflict but also shifted it from being between Jack and Rose to Jack and the group. This behavior, known as the *scapegoating fallacy*, involves shifting blame onto others. Addressing such confusing communication with a climate report alone is insufficient. To improve communication and comprehension within the group, it’s essential to practice active listening, create space, and pose unbiased questions.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

The effectiveness of these techniques depends on the response of an individual or group to a climate report. In her book *Jam Cultures*, Jitske Kramer delineates each response and how to address it. For example, they might initiate an attack, which often results in aggression, anger, and tears. Others might deny the climate report, make sarcastic jokes, change the topic, or talk over it. They could also begin to isolate themselves, form small groups, or adapt to the situation by becoming silent and waiting. They can also do like Jack did, be defensive or resistant, with many “Yeah, buts” emerging. People may not listen, or, if they do, they only listen to react and confirm their biases. In these situations, acknowledging emotions and reflecting on what you hear is crucial. In any scenario, active listening and demonstrating empathy for the individual or group are essential for reopening dialogue.

Let’s examine how this played out when Jack felt targeted by the climate report and exhibited the scapegoating fallacy. We asked him, “Why do you think the group isn’t engaging?” The question evidently troubled Jack, who responded with agitation, “How should I know? They hardly ever speak up!” To this, we replied, “I can imagine it’s difficult to understand others when they don’t speak up.” It’s important to recognize that we didn’t want to direct the conversation. Although we have our own opinions and assumptions based on our observations and understanding of rank, asking questions that are steering the conversation such as “Why do you think people don’t speak up?” wouldn’t lead to a breakthrough and could potentially make the situation worse. Our objective was to allow Jack to navigate his own way toward a breakthrough while we facilitated his journey. If Jack is unsure about the next step, he can ask for assistance, and then we would have an agreement with him to offer advice and pose questions. As a facilitator, it’s vital to establish this contract with the group or individual to preserve your neutrality and rank. Asking steering questions[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) can be risky, as it might be dismissed and negatively affect your role as an impartial facilitator.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

Only give the group or an individua[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)l advice when you’ve created a verbal contract with them in which they agreed to you giving them advice.

### 8.3.3 Creating role fluidity

[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)Sometimes, the conversation gets stuck by active listening and holding space, and leads to a dead end. From our experience using climate reports, active listening and holding space solves most of the sessions we’ve been in, but the conflict at BigScreen was brewing for a while, and, as you can see, you won’t solve that in one session. The conversation with Jack reached an impasse. When the heat of the conflict is this high, people are afraid to lose face to others. So, it’s hard for Jack to take responsibility and change his viewpoint. He already built alliances with other people, and the group is polarized. Polarized groups are stuck because they stopped understanding the other’s viewpoint and stopped relating others’ viewpoints within themselves. We call this cognitive dissonance because the other’s viewpoint can’t exist with their own. S[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)o, we need to[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) make these viewpoints fluid again, and the way Deep Democracy looks at these views is with role theory.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

#### Role theory

In the context of the Lewis Deep Democracy methodology, *role theory* refers to the idea that individuals and groups have distinct roles and responsibilities in a democratic system. These roles are shaped by the interplay of personal characteristics, social and cultural norms, and power structures, and they help to define the relationships between individuals and groups. A role can be anything someone can take a viewpoint in. It can have social roles such as a mother, daughter, or father, or they can be functional roles such as leader, researcher, supporter, architect, or engineer. They can also be personal roles such as extravert, pusher, analytic, or connecter. And don’t forget emotions such as anger, happiness, and sadness. In addition, thoughts, themes, ideas, opinions, behaviors, illnesses, dreams, and archetypes can also be roles. As Myrna Lewis says, “A role can be bloody anything[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)!” These roles can live both in the conscious and unconscious part of the group, as shown in figure 8.5.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

![Figure 8.5 The conscious and unconscious part of the group and an example of what roles there might be in both](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH08_F05_Baas.png)

Now we can identify with these roles and make them active in the consciousness of the group, as shown in figure 8.6. As an example, I can show that I’m happy, sad, or angry. Now that the group is aware that I’m happy, they can also be happy (for different reasons). So, a role is more than an individual. And, if I am happy, I can also be sad at the same time, or angry or hangry, or want to be with my cat and smother them. Therefore, an individual is more than a role. As long as people can identify with different roles in the unconsciousness and consciousness of the group, everything will be fine, and the session will flow smoothly. People will exchange and recognize themselves, for different reasons. It becomes problematic when we start identifying a person with a role. Like the Harry role we mentioned earlier, Harry is always weird. What happens after a while is that we can’t see Harry differently anymore. We projected Harry up, as they say, to be weird, and that stops the flow of the conversation. So, we want to create *role fluidity* and make sure people can keep identifying with all roles that show up. When we can recognize ourselves in others, we have dif[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)ferent conversations. We start to understand each other, conflict will be resolved, and peace can be made for this specific conflict.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

![Figure 8.6 How roles can get stuck to certain people or part of the group in isolated icebergs within the consciousness of the group. When this happens, the group gets into a conflict and can’t relate to the other role anymore.](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/baas/Figures/CH08_F06_Baas.png)

Check-in/outs, sensemaking, climate reports, active listening, and holding space already start creating role fluidity. You help to get the unconsciousness into the consciousness. But when conflicts are high, not even these tools will help to make the roles fluid. In our session, Jack was stuck in thinking the others took on the role of disengaged. He can’t see the role of being afraid to speak up, introvert, oppressed, or many other roles that the others could take on. When these tools aren’t sufficient, we can try to find alternatives in the group. You can ask the group who sees it differently than Jack. Now again, wait and see if you get an answer from the group. Eventually, Kala opened up and said, “I don’t speak up because I don’t know what problem your solutions usually solve.” Kala now identifies with a role of unknowing. Now it’s essential to spread that role actively in the group. Ask the group, “Who can somewhat relate to not knowing what the solutions solve?” Raise your hand to signal other people to do the same. You want to have a visual recognition from the group that they can relate to the role. It’s important to note that we add “somewhat” to our question about relating because while it’s hard to fully relate to the others for many different reasons, people are more likely to sort of relate to the others. Try to use[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) your own wording, and integrate these two sentences in your own facilitation to create better role fluidity.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

##### GUIDING HEURISTIC

When someone expresses a need or opinion, ask if someone sees it differently to make other opinions conscious in the group.

What happened next was that other developers raised their hands, and the conversation started to flow again. We didn’t solve the entire conflict in that session because that takes multiple sessions and coaching people one-on-one. But what we did succeed in at that meeting was bringing some shadows out of the unconsciousness of the group before they turned into demons by getting people to start listening to each other. The dominant symbol and pattern of the group here was that people in the team jumped to solutions fast, which didn’t give other people a chance to understand the problem as well. So, people didn’t feel part of the conversation anymore because they had the feeling they didn’t understand the problem correctly. That gave Rose and Jack an insight they never had, and, in the end, they agreed to be coached by us on how to make sure others are on the same page as them. It’s very hard to get agreements on solutions, but it’s easier to agree on the same need or problem. If we first start to understand and relate[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/) to each other’s needs, decision-making will be a lot easier. We’ll talk more about that in the next chapter.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)

## 8.4 Collaborative software design catalysts

-  Track behavioral patterns during collaborative modeling (or a meeting if you don’t do collaborative modeling yet). Write down your colleagues’ behavior, and mark how many times they show this specific behavior. Don’t bring this up during the meeting/session as we’re not trying to be a guardian angel here; we’re simply learning to observe behavior.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)
-  Examine the behavior that you wrote down. Try to determine how neutral you were when you were observing. Is there any judgment, assumption, or interpretation there? (Spoiler alert, there will be.) And see what you can do different next time in your behavior.
-  Schedule a one-on-one meeting with one of your colleagues to start a conversation. Try to use the steps of the climate report during this conversation. Be careful not to offer unsolicited advice. Remember, the goal is for people to feel heard so the conflict can de-escalate, not for you to solve this for them. If you want to help people feel safer, share not only the facts but also how they affected you—what emotions you experienced and ask them how they see it. For more on resolving one-on-one conflicts, refer to *Crucial Conversations* in the further reading section.
-  If you think there is a conflict going on between yourself and a colleague, you can apply the same steps. Be cautious though because it’s tricky to do this when you’re the one involved in the conflict; s[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)taying neutral is a lot harder. Focus on the other person feeling heard by you—the person they have a conflict with.

## 8.5 Chapter heuristics

*Guiding heuristics**[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)*

-  Whenever you encounter a conflict, determine if it’s a functional, task-based, or dysfunctional relationship conflict. Do this by figuring out if it’s task related or emotion related, and if it’s helping or hindering progress and outcome.
-  You know when a conflict turns dysfunctional when dialogues or discussions move toward the notion of right or wrong. As a facilitator, this is your cue to start resolving the conflict.
-  Frame discussions or disagreements as a dialogue or debate. People have a mental model of what a dialogue or debate is compared to a discussion or disagreement, and it will focus on ideas instead of personal conflict.
-  Investigate and reflect on the strong opinions you’re holding. What you think is wrong to do might make you lose your neutrality and keep you from facilitating the group the best way possible.
-  Use an interview to understand a conflict. During interviews, check the behavior people show, and plot these on the conflict stages to get a grasp of what kind of intervention is necessary.
-  When groups are stuck in a conversation, let the group move physically in an exercise. Movement trumps sitting, and it can help to unblock the flow of the conversation.
-  Address feedback and concerns to the entire group; avoid putting a spotlight on one or two individuals, especially when they are low in ranking.
-  Only give the group or an individual advice when you’ve created a verbal contract with them in which they agreed to you giving them advice.
-  When someone expresses a need or opinion, ask if someone sees it differently to make other opinions conscious in the group.

## Summary

-  Conflict and resistance have negative connotations, but, in reality, conflict is a difference of opinion between two or more people and is natural.
-  Suppressed or ignored conflicts can lead to resistance and edge behavior.
-  Edge behavior is a result of conflict avoidance and is shown by a person who wants to avoid conflict but doesn’t feel comfortable addressing it yet.
-  It’s important not to judge edge behavior, as it’s hard to sit in one’s discomfort.
-  Resistance and conflict aren’t necessarily negative and can indicate important topics at the root cause of hindrances.
-  Facilitation is crucial in resolving resistance and conflict in collaborative modeling.
-  Resistance and conflict are related to other social dynamics such as cognitive bias and ranking.
-  Observing behavior and communication patterns can indicate resistance and conflict in collaborative modeling.
-  Confusing communication patterns include indirectness, interrupting, questions that aren’t questions, and fallacious arguments.
-  Making assumptions can result in bias blind spot, and inner conflicts and biases can turn into negative behavior, leading to resistance and tension in the group and preventing effective facilitation
-  Writing down and reflecting on patterns observed during meetings helps you categorize patterns over time.
-  A conflict has many different stages that require different approaches for dealing with them.
-  A climate report provides neutral feedback to the group about their behavior and the observations that were made using the group’s own words that they can relate to. It can help the group deal with a conflict themselves
-  A facilitator must maintain their neutral rank by not giving unsolicited advice, but instead offering assistance through a contract with the group or individual.
-  Role theory in Deep Democracy and the Lewis Deep Democracy method refers to the concept that individuals and groups have specific roles and responsibilities in a democratic system.
-  A role can be anything that someone can take a viewpoint in, including social roles, personal roles, emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and so on, and these roles can exist both in the conscious and unconscious part of a group.
-  The goal is to create role fluidity, where individuals can identify with different roles and the group can recognize themselves in each other.[](/book/collaborative-software-design/chapter-8/)
