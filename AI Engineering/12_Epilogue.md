# Epilogue

This is some text.

You made it! You just finished a technical book with more than 150,000 words, 160 illustrations, 250 footnotes, and 975 reference links.

Being able to set aside time to learn is a privilege. I’m grateful for the opportunity to write this book and learn new things. And I’m grateful that you chose to give this book your valuable learning time.

The hardest part of technical writing isn’t finding the correct answers but asking the right questions. Writing this book inspired me to ask many questions that guided me toward fun and useful discoveries. I hope the book sparked some interesting questions for you as well.

There are already so many incredible applications built on top of foundation models. There’s no doubt that this number will grow exponentially in the future. More systematic approaches to AI engineering, such as those introduced in this book, will make the development process easier, enabling even more applications. If there are any use cases you want to discuss, don’t hesitate to reach out. I love hearing about interesting problems and solutions.

AI engineering has a lot of challenges. Not all of them are fun, but all of them are opportunities for growth and impact. I can’t wait to learn more about what you’ll build!
