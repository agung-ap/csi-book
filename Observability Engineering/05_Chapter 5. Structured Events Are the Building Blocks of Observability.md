# Chapter 5. Structured Events Are the Building Blocks of Observability

In this chapter, we examine the fundamental building block of observability: the structured event. Observability is a measure of how well you can understand and explain any state your system can get into, no matter how novel or bizarre. To do that, you must be able to get answers to any question you can ask, without anticipating or predicting a need to answer that question in advance. For that to be possible, several technical prerequisites must first be met.

Throughout this book, we address the many technical prerequisites necessary for observability. In this chapter, we start with the telemetry needed to understand and explain any state your system may be in. Asking *any* question, about any combination of telemetry details, requires the ability to arbitrarily slice and dice data along any number of dimensions. It also requires that your telemetry be gathered in full resolution, down to the lowest logical level of granularity that also retains the context in which it was gathered. For observability, that means gathering telemetry at the per service or per request level.

With old-fashioned-style metrics, you had to define custom metrics up front if you wanted to ask a new question and gather new telemetry to answer it. In a metrics world, the way to get answers to any possible question is to gather and store every possible metric—which is simply impossible (and, even if it were possible, prohibitively expensive). Further, metrics do not retain the context of the event, simply an aggregate measurement of what occurred at a particular time. With that aggregate view, you could not ask new questions or look for new outliers in the existing data set.

With observability, you can ask new questions of your existing telemetry data at any time, without needing to first predict what those questions might be. In an observable system, you must be able to iteratively explore system aspects ranging from high-level aggregate performance all the way down to the raw data used in individual requests.

The technical requirement making that possible starts with the data format needed for observability: the arbitrarily wide structured event. Collecting these events is not optional. It is not an implementation detail. It is a requirement that makes any level of analysis possible within that wide-ranging view.

# Debugging with Structured Events

First, let’s start by defining an event. For the purpose of understanding the impact to your production services, an *event* is a record of everything that occurred while one particular request interacted with your service.

To create that record, you start by initializing an empty map right at the beginning, when the request first enters your service. During the lifetime of that request, any interesting details about what occurred—unique IDs, variable values, headers, every parameter passed by the request, the execution time, any calls made to remote services, the execution time of those remote calls, or any other bit of context that may later be valuable in debugging—get appended to that map. Then, when the request is about to exit or error, that entire map is captured as a rich record of what just happened. The data written to that map is organized and formatted, as key-value pairs, so that it’s easily searchable: in other words, the data should be structured. That’s a *structured event*.

As you debug problems in your service, you will compare structured events to one another to find anomalies. When some events behave significantly differently from others, you will then work to identify what those outliers have in common. Exploring those outliers requires filtering and grouping by different dimensions—and combinations of dimensions—contained within those events that might be relevant to your investigation.

The data that you feed into your observability system as structured events needs to capture the right level of abstraction to help observers determine the state of your applications, no matter how bizarre or novel. Information that is helpful for investigators may have runtime information not specific to any given request (such as container information or versioning information), as well as information about each request that passes through the service (such as shopping cart ID, user ID, or session token). Both types of data are useful for debugging.

The sort of data that is relevant to debugging a request will vary, but it helps to think about that by comparing the type of data that would be useful when using a conventional debugger. For example, in that setting, you might want to know the values of variables during the execution of the request and to understand when function calls are happening. With distributed services, those function calls may happen as multiple calls to remote services. In that setting, any data about the values of variables during request execution can be thought of as the *context* of the request.

All of that data should be accessible for debugging and stored in your events. They are *arbitrarily wide events*, because the debugging data you need may encompass a significant number of fields. There should be no practical limit to the details you can attach to your events. We’ll delve further into the types of information that should be captured in structured events, but first let’s compare how capturing system state with structured events differs from traditional debugging methods.

# The Limitations of Metrics as a Building Block

First, let’s define *metrics*. Unfortunately, this term requires disambiguation because often it is used as a generic synonym for “telemetry” (e.g., “all of our metrics are up and to the right, boss!”). For clarity, when we refer to metrics, we mean the scalar values collected to represent system state, with tags optionally appended for grouping and searching those numbers. Metrics are the staple upon which traditional monitoring of software systems has been built (refer to [Chapter 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/ch01.html#what_is_observabilityquestion_mark) for a more detailed look at the origin of metrics in this sense).

However, the fundamental limitation of a metric is that it is a pre-aggregated measure. The numerical values generated by a metric reflect an aggregated report of system state over a predefined period of time. When that number is reported to a monitoring system, that pre-aggregated measure now becomes the lowest possible level of granularity for examining system state. That aggregation obscures many possible problems. Further, a request into your service may be represented by having a part in hundreds of metrics over the course of its execution. Those metrics are all distinct measures—disconnected from one another—that lack the sort of connective tissue and granularity necessary to reconstruct exactly which metrics belong to the same request.

For example, a metric for `page_load_time` might examine the average time it took for all active pages to load during the trailing five-second period. Another metric for `requests_per_second` might examine the number of HTTP connections any given service had open during the trailing one-second period. Metrics reflect system state, as expressed by numerical values derived by measuring any given property over a given period of time. The behavior of all requests that were active during that period are aggregated into one numerical value. In this example, investigating what occurred during the lifespan of any one particular request flowing through that system would provide a trail of breadcrumbs that leads to both of these metrics. However, the level of available granularity necessary to dig further is unavailable.

###### Note

Delving into how metrics are stored in TSDBs is beyond the scope of this chapter, but it is partially addressed in [Chapter 16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/ch16.html#efficient_data_storage). For a more in-depth look at how metrics and TSDBs are incompatible with observability, we recommend Alex Vondrak’s 2021 blog post, [“How Time Series Databases Work—and Where They Don’t”](https://hny.co/blog/time-series-database).

In an event-based approach, a web server request could be instrumented to record each parameter (or dimension) submitted with the request (for example, `userid`), the intended subdomain (`www`, `docs`, `support`, `shop`, `cdn`, etc.), total duration time, any dependent child requests, the various services involved (`web`, `database`, `auth`, `billing`) to fulfill those child requests, the duration of each child request, and more. Those events can then be arbitrarily sliced and diced across various dimensions, across any window of time, to present any view relevant to an investigation.

In contrast to metrics, events are snapshots of what happened at a particular point in time. One thousand discrete events may have occurred within that same trailing five-second period in the preceding example. If each event recorded its own `page_load_time`, when aggregated along with the other 999 events that happened in that same five-second period, you could still display the same average value as shown by the metric. Additionally, with the granularity provided by events, an investigator could also compute that same average over a one-second period, or subdivide queries by fields like user ID or hostname to find correlations with `page_load_time` in ways that simply aren’t possible when using the aggregated value provided by metrics.

An extreme counterargument to this analysis could be that, given enough metrics, the granularity needed to see system state on the level of individual requests could be achieved. Putting aside the wildly impractical nature of that approach, ignoring that concurrency could never completely be accounted for, and that investigators would still be required to stitch together which metrics were generated along the path of a request’s execution, the fact remains that metrics-based monitoring systems are simply not designed to scale to the degree necessary to capture those measures. Regardless, many teams relying on metrics for debugging find themselves in an escalating arms race of continuously adding more and more metrics in an attempt to do just that.

As aggregate numerical representations of predefined relationships over predefined periods of time, metrics serve as only one narrow view of one system property. Their granularity is too large and their ability to present system state in alternate views is too rigid to achieve observability. Metrics are too limiting to serve as the fundamental building block of observability.

# The Limitations of Traditional Logs as a Building Block

As seen earlier, structured data is clearly defined and searchable. Unstructured data isn’t organized in an easily searchable manner and is usually stored in its native format. When it comes to debugging production software systems, the most prevalent use of unstructured data is from a construct older than metrics. Let’s examine the use of logs.

Before jumping into this section, we should note that it is modern logging practice to use structured logs. But just in case you haven’t transitioned to using structured logs, let’s start with a look at what unstructured logs are and how to make them more useful.

## Unstructured Logs

*Log files* are essentially large blobs of unstructured text, designed to be readable by humans but difficult for machines to process. These files are documents generated by applications and various underlying infrastructure systems that contain a record of all notable events—as defined by a configuration file somewhere—that have occurred. For decades, they have been an essential part of system debugging applications in any environment. Logs typically contain tons of useful information: a description of the event that happened, an associated timestamp, a severity-level type associated with that event, and a variety of other relevant metadata (user ID, IP address, etc.).

Traditional logs are *unstructured* because they were designed to be human readable. Unfortunately, for purposes of human readability, logs often separate the vivid details of one event into multiple lines of text, like so:

```
6:01:00 accepted connection on port 80 from 10.0.0.3:63349
6:01:03 basic authentication accepted for user foo
6:01:15 processing request for /super/slow/server
6:01:18 request succeeded, sent response code 200
6:01:19 closed connection to 10.0.0.3:63349
```

While that sort of narrative structure can be helpful when first learning the intricacies of a service in development, it generates huge volumes of noisy data that becomes slow and clunky in production. In production, these chunks of narrative are often interspersed throughout millions upon millions of other lines of text. Typically, they’re useful in the course of debugging once a cause is already suspected and an investigator is verifying their hypothesis by digging through logs for verification.

However, modern systems no longer run at an easily comprehensible human scale. In traditional monolithic systems, human operators had a very small number of services to manage. Logs were written to the local disk of the machines where applications ran. In the modern era, logs are often streamed to a centralized aggregator, where they’re dumped into very large storage backends.

Searching through millions of lines of unstructured logs can be accomplished by using some type of log file parser. *Parsers* split log data into chunks of information and attempt to group them in meaningful ways. However, with unstructured data, parsing gets complicated because different formatting rules (or no rules at all) exist for different types of log files. Logging tools are full of different approaches to solving this problem, with varying degrees of success, performance, and usability.

## Structured Logs

The solution is to instead create *structured* log data designed for machine parsability. From the preceding example, a structured version might instead look something like this:

```
time="6:01:00" msg="accepted connection" port="80" authority="10.0.0.3:63349"
time="6:01:03" msg="basic authentication accepted" user="foo"
time="6:01:15" msg="processing request" path="/super/slow/server"
time="6:01:18" msg="sent response code" status="200"
time="6:01:19" msg="closed connection" authority="10.0.0.3:63349"
```

Many logs are only portions of events, regardless of whether those logs are structured. When connecting observability approaches to logging, it helps to think of an event as a unit of work within your systems. A structured event should contain information about what it took for a service to perform a unit of work. A *unit of work* can be seen as somewhat relative. For example, a unit of work could be downloading a single file, parsing it, and extracting specific pieces of information. Yet other times, it could mean processing an answer after extracting specific pieces of information from dozens of files. In the context of services, a unit of work could be accepting an HTTP request and doing everything necessary to return a response. Yet other times, one HTTP request can generate many other events during its execution.

Ideally, a structured event should be scoped to contain everything about what it took to perform that unit of work. It should record the input necessary to perform the work, any attributes gathered—whether computed, resolved, or discovered—along the way, the conditions of the service as it was performing the work, and details about the result of the work performed.

It’s common to see anywhere from a few to a few dozen log lines or entries that, when taken together, represent what could be considered one unit of work. So far, the example we’ve been using does just that: one unit of work (the handling of one connection) is represented by five separate log entries. Rather than being helpfully grouped into one event, the messages are spread out into many messages. Sometimes, a common field—like a request ID—might be present in each entry so that the separate entries can be stitched together. But typically there won’t be.

The log lines in our example could instead be rolled up into one singular event. Doing so would make it look like this:

```
time="2019-08-22T11:56:11-07:00" level=info msg="Served HTTP request" 
authority="10.0.0.3:63349" duration_ms=123 path="/super/slow/server" port=80 
service_name="slowsvc" status=200 trace.trace_id=eafdf3123 user=foo
```

That representation can be formatted in different ways, including JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Most commonly, this type of event information could appear as a JSON object, like so:

```json
{
"authority":"10.0.0.3:63349",
"duration_ms":123,
"level":"info",
"msg":"Served HTTP request",
"path":"/super/slow/server",
"port":80,
"service_name":"slowsvc",
"status":200,
"time":"2019-08-22T11:57:03-07:00",
"trace.trace_id":"eafdf3123",
"user":"foo"
}
```

The goal of observability is to enable you to interrogate your event data in arbitrary ways to understand the internal state of your systems. Any data used to do so must be machine-parsable in order to facilitate that goal. Unstructured data is simply unusable for that task. Log data can, however, be useful when redesigned to resemble a structured event, the fundamental building block of observability.

# Properties of Events That Are Useful in Debugging

Earlier in this chapter, we defined a structured event as a record of everything that occurred while one particular request interacted with your service. When debugging modern distributed systems, that is approximately the right scope for a unit of work. To create a system where an observer can understand any state of the system—no matter how novel or complex—an event must contain ample information that may be relevant to an investigation.

The backend data store for an observable system must allow your events to be arbitrarily wide. When using structured events to understand service behavior, remember that the model is to initialize an empty blob and record anything that may be relevant for later debugging. That can mean pre-populating the blob with data known as the request enters your service: request parameters, environmental information, runtime internals, host/container statistics, etc. As the request is executing, other valuable information may be discovered: user ID, shopping cart ID, other remote services to be called to render a result, or any various bits of information that may help you find and identify this request in the future. As the request exits your service, or returns an error, there are several bits of data about how the unit of work was performed: duration, response code, error messages, etc. It is common for events generated with mature instrumentation to contain 300 to 400 dimensions per event.

Debugging novel problems typically means discovering previously unknown failure modes (*unknown-unknowns*) by searching for events with outlying conditions and finding patterns or correlating them. For example, if a spike of errors occurs, you may need to slice across various event dimensions to find out what they all have in common. To make those correlations, your observability solution will need the ability to handle fields with high cardinality.

###### Note

*Cardinality* refers to the number of unique elements in a set, as you remember from [Chapter 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/ch01.html#what_is_observabilityquestion_mark). Some dimensions in your events will have very low or very high cardinality. Any dimension containing unique identifiers will have the highest possible cardinality. Refer back to [“The Role of Cardinality”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/ch01.html#the_role_of_cardinality) for more on this topic.

An observability tool must be able to support high-cardinality queries to be useful to an investigator. In modern systems, many of the dimensions that are most useful for debugging novel problems have high cardinality. Investigation also often requires stringing those high-cardinality dimensions together (i.e., high dimensionality) to find deeply hidden problems. Debugging problems is often like trying to find a needle in a haystack. High cardinality and high dimensionality are the capabilities that enable you to find very fine-grained needles in deeply complex distributed system haystacks.

For example, to get to the source of an issue, you may need to create a query that finds “all Canadian users, running iOS11 version 11.0.4, using the French language pack, who installed the app last Tuesday, running firmware version 1.4.101, who are storing photos on shard3 in region us-west-1.” Every single one of those constraints is a high-cardinality dimension.

As mentioned earlier, to enable that functionality, events must be *arbitrarily wide*: fields within an event cannot be limited to known or predictable fields. Limiting ingestible events to containing known fields may be an artificial constraint imposed by the backend storage system used by a particular analysis tool. For example, some backend data stores may require predefining data schemas. Predefining a schema requires that users of the tool be able to predict, in advance, which dimensions may need to be captured. Using schemas or other strict limitations on data types, or shapes, are also orthogonal to the goals of observability (see [Chapter 16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/ch16.html#efficient_data_storage)).

# Conclusion

The fundamental building block of observability is the arbitrarily wide structured event. Observability requires the ability to slice and dice data along any number of dimensions, in order to answer any question when iteratively stepping your way through a debugging process. Structured events must be arbitrarily wide because they need to contain sufficient data to enable investigators to understand everything that was happening when a system accomplished one unit of work. For distributed services, that typically means scoping an event as the record of everything that happened during the lifetime of one individual service request.

Metrics aggregate system state over a predefined period of time. They serve as only one narrow view of one system property. Their granularity is too large, and their ability to present system state in alternate views is too rigid, to stitch them together to represent one unit of work for any particular service request. Metrics are too limiting to serve as the fundamental building block of observability.

Unstructured logs are human readable but computationally difficult to use. Structured logs are machine parsable and can be useful for the goals of observability, presuming they are redesigned to resemble a structured event.

For now, we’ll simply concentrate on the data type necessary for telemetry. In the next few chapters, we’ll more closely examine why analyzing high-cardinality and high-dimensionality data is important. We will also further define the necessary capabilities for a tool to enable observability. Next, let’s start by looking at how structured events can be stitched together to create traces.
