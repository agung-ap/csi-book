# Part 2. Master database design

Welcome to the heart of database design! This part takes you beyond the basics and into the art and science of creating robust, efficient, and scalable databases. Here, you’ll learn how to structure data not just to store it but also to enable powerful, reliable applications.

### Chapter 4 — Entities and attributes
Chapter 4 begins with entities and attributes—the building blocks of any database. You’ll discover how to map real-world objects and concepts to entities and attributes and how to select the right data types so your structures are expressive, consistent, and future-proof.

### Chapter 5 — Relationships
Chapter 5 focuses on relationships, demonstrating how to create meaningful connections among entities. By the end of this chapter, you’ll know how to translate real-world interactions into a coherent, well-structured schema that supports integrity and flexibility.

### Chapter 6 — Normalization and implementation
Chapter 6 introduces normalization and implementation. You’ll learn how to refine and strengthen your designs through the normal forms, understand when (and when not) to denormalize, and translate your logical design into SQL DDL and DML—bridging the gap between theory and practice.

### Chapter 7 — Security and optimization
Chapter 7 delves into security and optimization. You’ll explore principles of least privilege, access control patterns, and data protection, then shift to performance with indexing strategies, query tuning, and judicious denormalization.

### What you will gain
By the end of this part, you’ll have the expertise to design databases that meet the demands of real-world applications. Whether you’re building a small project or tackling a complex enterprise system, you will be equipped to handle the challenges of modern database design with confidence and precision.

### Quick reference
- Model entities and choose data types that reflect real-world meaning (Chapter 4)
- Define relationships that enforce integrity and support rich queries (Chapter 5)
- Normalize for clarity; denormalize deliberately for performance (Chapter 6)
- Secure data and optimize workloads with indexing and access strategies (Chapter 7)

### Suggested mindset while reading
- Think in terms of trade-offs, not absolutes.
- Treat every schema choice as both a design and communication decision.
- Favor clarity first; optimize when you have measurable pressure.
- Iterate: great schemas evolve alongside product understanding.
