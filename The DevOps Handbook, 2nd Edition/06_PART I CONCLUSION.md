PART I CONCLUSION

In Part I of The DevOps Handbook, we looked back at several movements in history that helped lead to the development of DevOps. We also looked at the three main principles that form the foundation for successful DevOps organizations: the principles of Flow, Feedback, and Continual Learning and Experimentation. In [Part II](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-devops-handbook/9781098182281/18-part-2.xhtml), we will begin to look at how to start a DevOps movement in your organization.
