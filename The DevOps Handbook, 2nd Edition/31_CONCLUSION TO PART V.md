CONCLUSION TO PART V

Throughout Part V, we have explored the practices that help create a culture of learning and experimentation in your organization. Learning from incidents, creating shared repositories, and sharing learnings is essential when we work in complex systems, helping to make our work culture more just and our systems safer and more resilient.

In [Part VI](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-devops-handbook/9781098182281/47-part-6.xhtml), we’ll explore how to extend flow, feedback, and learning and experimentation by using them to simultaneously help us achieve our Information Security goals.
