PART II CONCLUSION

In Part II: Where to Start, we explored a variety of ways to think about DevOps transformations, including how to choose where to start, relevant aspects of architecture and organizational design, and how to organize our teams. We also explored how to integrate Operations into all aspects of Development planning and daily work.

In [Part III](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-devops-handbook/9781098182281/25-part-3.xhtml): The First Way: The Technical Practices of Flow, we will now start to explore how to implement the specific technical practices to realize the principles of flow, which enable the fast flow of work from Development to Operations without causing chaos and disruption downstream.
