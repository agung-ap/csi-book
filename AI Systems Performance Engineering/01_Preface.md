# Preface

In the vibrant streets of San Francisco, where innovation is as common as traffic on the 101 highway, I find myself immersed in the awesome world of artificial intelligence. The rapid advancements in AI are redefining the very fabric of our daily lives. From personalization and recommendation engines in the 2000’s and 2010’s to AI assistants and autonomous vehicles in the 2020’s and 2030’s, AI’s influence is pervasive and profound.​

My journey into this fast-moving field was driven by a curiosity to understand the intricate balance between hardware and software that powers AI systems. A few years ago, it became evident that the performance of AI applications was dependent on sophisticated algorithms as well as the underlying hardware and software that support them. The synergy and co-design between cutting-edge hardware, meticulous software, and clever algorithms is critical in achieving unprecedented levels of efficiency and scalability.​

This realization inspired me to dive deep into the realm of “full-stack” AI performance engineering. I wanted to understand how many components including processors, memory architectures, network interconnects, operating systems, and software frameworks all interact to create robust and efficient AI systems. The complexity of these interactions presented both challenges and opportunities, fueling my desire to unravel the intricacies of this unique combination of technologies.​

This book is a realization of my initial exploration as well as many years of hands-on ML and AI system design experience. It is created for engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts who are eager to understand the underpinnings of AI systems performance at all levels. Whether you’re building AI applications, optimizing neural network training strategies, designing and managing scalable inference servers, or simply fascinated by the mechanics of modern AI systems, this book provides the insights that bridge theory and practice across multiple disciplines.​

Throughout the chapters, we will embark on a journey that examines the evolution of hardware architectures, dive into the nuances of software optimization, and explore real-world case studies that highlight the patterns and best practices of building both high-performance and cost-efficient AI systems. Each section is designed to build upon the last, creating a cohesive narrative from foundational concepts to advanced applications.​

Although I’m the sole author of this book, this was not a sole endeavor. I am indebted to the brilliant minds whose research and innovations have paved the way for the topics covered in this book. Their contributions have been instrumental in shaping the content and depth of this work. To my colleagues, mentors, and reviewers who challenged my perspectives and enriched my understanding, your insights are embedded in every chapter. And to my family and friends whose continuous support kept me writing through the night and into the early morning hours, I extend much heartfelt gratitude.

As we continue to push the frontiers of artificial intelligence and supercomputing, the knowledge in this book aims to inspire, educate, and empower the reader. The journey through the complexities of AI Systems Performance Engineering is not just a technical exploration - it’s a reminder of human ingenuity, the need to understand our surroundings, and a desire to continuously improve through technology and innovation. There are few people in this world who understand the fundamentals of co-designing hardware, software, and algorithms for maximum performance and efficiency. After reading this book, you will be one of them.
