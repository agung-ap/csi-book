# Part II Conclusion

Performance and scalability are important properties of any database system. The storage engine and node-local read-write path can have a larger impact on *performance* of the system: how quickly it can process requests locally. At the same time, a subsystem responsible for communication in the cluster often has a larger impact on the *scalability* of the database system: maximum cluster size and capacity. However, the storage engine can only be used for a limited number of use cases if it’s not scalable and its performance degrades as the dataset grows. At the same time, putting a slow atomic commit protocol on top of the fastest storage engine will not yield good results.

Distributed, cluster-wide, and node-local processes are interconnected, and have to be considered holistically. When designing a database system, you have to consider how different subsystems fit and work together.

Part II began with a discussion of how distributed systems are different from single-node applications, and which difficulties are to be expected in such environments.

We discussed the basic distributed system building blocks, different consistency models, and several important classes of distributed algorithms, some of which can be used to implement these consistency models:

Failure detectionIdentify remote process failures accurately and efficiently.

Leader electionQuickly and reliably choose a single process to temporarily serve as a coordinator.

DisseminationReliably distribute information using peer-to-peer communication.

Anti-entropyIdentify and repair state divergence between the nodes.

Distributed transactionsExecute series of operations against multiple partitions atomically.

ConsensusReach an agreement between remote participants while tolerating process failures.

These algorithms are used in many database systems, message queues, schedulers, and other important infrastructure software. Using the knowledge from this book, you’ll be able to better understand how they work, which, in turn, will help to make better decisions about which software to use, and identify potential problems.
