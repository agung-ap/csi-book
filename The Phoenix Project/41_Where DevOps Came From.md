# Where DevOps Came From

One hundred years from now, historians will look back at this decade and conclude that something transformative happened: how we worked inside Development and IT Operations changed completely.… I predict that historians will call this decade the “Cambrian explosion for IT,” a time of incredible innovation and disruption when, 50 years after the birth of computing, we finally learned what technology was good for.

The term “devops” was originally coined by Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer in 2008,[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-8) and it entered common usage in 2009 in the Velocity Conference community with the famous “10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr” presentation, given by John Allspaw and Paul Hammond.[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-9)

In this book, we refer to “DevOps” as the outcome of applying Lean principles to the IT value stream. These principles are based on more than a century of sound management practices. However, instead of being applied to the transformation of physical goods, we are using these principles to accelerate flow of work through Product Management, Development, Test, IT Operations, and InfoSec.

DevOps has benefitted tremendously from the work the Agile Community has done, showing how small teams operating with high trust combined with small batch sizes and smaller, more frequent software releases can dramatically increase productivity of Development organizations. In fact, many of the key moments in the DevOps history happened at Agile conferences, in addition to the incredibly vibrant DevOpsDays events happening around the world since the first one was held in 2009.

And of course, DevOps extends and builds upon the practices of “infrastructure as code” pioneered by Dr. Mark Burgess, as well as continuous integration and continuous deployment (pioneered by Jez Humble and David Farley), which is a prerequisite to achieving fast deployment flow.

DevOps also benefits from an astounding convergence of philosophical management movements, such as Lean Startup, Innovation Culture, Toyota Kata, Rugged Computing, and the Velocity community. All of these mutually reinforce each other, creating the conditions of a powerful coalition of forces that can accelerate DevOps adoption.
