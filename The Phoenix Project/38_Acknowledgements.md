# Acknowledgements

*First and foremost,* I want to acknowledge all the support from my loving wife, who put up with far more than I promised, Margueritte, and my sons, Reid, Parker, and Grant.

I want to thank Todd Sattersten, Tim Grahl, Merridawn Duckler, and Kate Sage for their incredible help and support throughout the development process of this book. Also, my profound thanks to the tireless contributions and scrutiny from Paul Muller from HP, Paul Proctor from Gartner, Branden Williams from RSA, Dr. Tom Longstaff at Johns Hopkins University, Julia Allen from SEI/CMU, Adrian Cockcroft from Netflix, Christopher Little from BMC, Bob McCarthy, Lisa Schwartz from ITSM Academy, Jennifer Bayuk, Ben Rockwood from Joyent, Josh Corman from Akamai, James Turnbull from Puppet Labs, Charlie Betz from Enterprise Management Associates, Dr. Gene Spafford from CERIAS at Purdue University, Dwayne Melancon from Tripwire, and Michael Krigsman from Asuret.

I also want to attribute the contributions of my fellow coauthors of *The DevOps Cookbook*, Patrick DeBois, John Wills, and Mike Orzen. Among others, they helped crystallize the practices that became *The Three Ways* that Erik talked about.

I want to acknowledge John Allspaw, Paul Hammond, and Jez Humble for their groundbreaking and seminal contributions of showing how fast flow in the IT value stream is really done.

And thank you to all the other reviewers who helped shape the manuscript: David Allen, David Bills, Kip Boyle, Shane Carlson, Carlos Casanova, Scott Crawford, Iris Culpepper, Mike Dahn, Chris Eng, Paul Farrall, Daniel Francisco, Kevin Hood, Matt Hooper, Tom Howarth, Kevin Kenan, Paul Love, Norman Marks, Tom McAndrew, Ally Miller, David Mortman, Wendy Nather, Michael Nygard, John Pierce, Dennis Ravenelle, Sasha Romanosky, Susan Ryan, Fred Scholl, Lawrence “Butch” Sheets, Bill Shinn, Adam Shostack, Ariel Silverstone, Dan Swanson, Joe “Feech” Telafici, Jan Vromant, and Lenny Zeltser.

The methodology used to create, link, and compute Dick’s organizational KPIs to IT activities is based on the Risk-Adjusted Value ManagementTM methodology, developed by Paul Proctor and Michael Smith at Gartner, Inc.

The tool used to scope the specific audit internal control objectives to specific IT controls is called GAIT, developed by the Institute of Internal Auditors.

And my heartiest thank you to my assistant, Hannah Concannon, who made it possible for me to focus on writing and finishing the book, as well as helping me do all the final edits.

I want to also acknowledge Tim Ferriss and the help of the other alumni of the Kimono group, who helped me understand the theory and practice of book launches.

*I would like to thank my wife, Erica,* and my daughters, Emily and Rachel, for their patience and understanding with my chosen profession, which requires so much travel. Special thanks to my joyfully subversive serial coconspirators, Gene Kim and George Spafford, for being highly adaptable and tolerating my loquacious rants.

I have been ridiculously fortunate to work with some of the most creative and brilliant CXOs in my practice over the years, such as Will “Prefontaine” Weider, CIO of Ministry Healthcare; Robert Slepin, CIO of John C. Lincoln Health Network; Oliver Eckel, CEO of Cognosec; Rob Leahy, CFO of Transdermal Corporation; Jeff Hughes, VP of Radiant Systems; Paul O’Neil, CEO of Kerzner International; and Nana Palmer, COO of Kerzner International—you all have taught me so much about courage in experimentation and radically improving IT throughput.

Lastly, I would like to thank my friend and partner in crime for many of these improvement learnings, John Dennin, Senior Engagement Manager at Assemblage Pointe, Inc.

*The journey from **Visible Ops* to *When *IT* Fails* further cemented my utmost respect and appreciation for Gene and Kevin. The challenges and exchanges we’ve had in the course of writing this book tested our collective abilities to put in writing what we have encountered in reality in the IT industry.

Gentlemen, thank you very much!

Most importantly, thank you for the unwavering love, motivation, support, and patience of my better half, Rowena. Thank you to my children, Paolo, Alyssa, and Erika, who all unselfishly put up with my chaotic and time-consuming schedule, even when on vacation. To my parents, Carroll and Alpha, thank you for instilling in me a love of learning. You have been an instrumental part in my continued quest to keep improving in all aspects of my life.
