# Further Reading

One of the most requested items has been a list of recommended reading and further resources to learn more about the philosophies, tools, and techniques that were used in the book. I consulted many sources for the actual planning and construction of the novel. I was trained as a Theory of Constraints Jonah, a kanban practitioner, and an acolyte in the Toyota Kata; I wove Visible Ops into the book. Here I’ve provided a list of these resources plus other guides to replicate the transformation that Bill pulled off with Erik’s help at Parts Unlimited.

## *The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement*

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt wrote his seminal book, *The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement*, in 1984. It’s a Socratic novel about Alex Rogo, a plant manager who must fix his cost and due date issues in ninety days, or his plant will be shut down. This book has been incorporated into many MBA curriculums, influenced multiple generations of business leaders, and sold over six million copies to date.

My coauthors and I studied this book for nearly a decade, getting ready to write *The Phoenix Project*. In many ways, I view our book as an homage to *The Goal*. We attempted to mirror most of the book structure and plot elements, while making it contemporary, relevant, and, I hope, more dramatic. (I’d like to think that *The Phoenix Project* is what Dr. Goldratt would have written if he wrote *The Goal* today, and had Tarantino or Scorsese as a novel coach.)

In *The Goal*, Dr. Goldratt starts to describe the steps in the Theory of Constraints (TOC) methodology. Briefly, the five original TOC steps are:

- Identify the constraint
- Exploit the constraint
- Subordinate all other activities to the constraint
- Elevate the constraint to new levels
- Find the next constraint

In *The Goal*, the constraints were initially the famous NCX-10 robot, then the heat treat ovens, and then the constraint becomes market demand. In *The Phoenix Project*, the constraint was initially Brent because he was always dealing with unplanned work, then the application deployment process, and then the constraint moved outside the organization because the needed MRP application support was outsourced.

In Dr. Goldratt’s following book, *It’s Not Luck*, he describes what he called the Thinking Processes, which is a fantastic (but somewhat inaccessible and often very slow) methodology of identifying core, chronic conflicts, capturing the current reality, describing the desired future reality, and various planning techniques to increase the likelihood of getting there successfully.

By far, the very best overview of the entire TOC, the Thinking Processes, and Dr. Goldratt’s body of knowledge is an audiobook called *Beyond The Goal*. It includes all of his recorded lectures from 2005 and is a breathtaking tour of Dr. Goldratt’s life journey, describing his contributions, tools, and case studies.

Eight years ago, it was well known that the Thinking Processes were the tools and techniques he used to construct *The Goal*. That’s why my coauthors and I tried to learn more about it, but we couldn’t find any training or books, beyond Dr. Goldratt’s writings, that were feasible for us to attend or buy. Nor were there any nontrivial (or correct) examples that we could find by scouring the Internet. Much has changed since then.

For anyone interested in becoming an expert in TOC and the Thinking Processes, I wholehearted recommend Dr. James Holt’s EM 526 Constraints Management and EM 530 Applications of Constraints Management courses, offered online through Washington State University. They both prepare students to become trained as “a Jonah,” the Yoda-like character in *The Goal* who was obviously the embodiment of Dr. Goldratt.[18](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-18)

If you want to learn more about the Thinking Processes, I’d recommend Dr. H. William Dettmer’s textbook, *The Logical Thinking Process*, although it is not light reading. And many shortcuts have been developed that are not reflected in Dr. Dettmer’s book, so danger lies in this path.

## *The Five Dysfunctions of A Team: A Leadership Fable*

The technique that Steve, the Parts Unlimited CEO, uses in part 2, chapter 18 is modeled after Patrick Lencioni’s methodology described in *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable*. He posits that one of the core contributors to a team’s inability to achieve goals is due to lack of trust. In his model, the five dysfunctions are described as:

- Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group
- Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate
- Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization
- Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior, which sets low standards
- Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success

When I think about the long, bitter intertribal warfare that has existed between Development and IT Operations, as well as between IT and “the business,” I suspect that we will very much need the lessons of Mr. Lencioni to achieve the DevOps ideal.

Often, the first step in using Mr. Lencioni’s methodology is for leaders to enable themselves to become vulnerable (or at the very least, start by modeling vulnerable behaviors).[19](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-19) In *The Phoenix Project*, Steve has already internalized these practices for decades and leads what is called a personal history exercise.[20](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-20)

I was fortunate enough to have personally observed and benefited from his techniques being used. When my old boss, Jim B. Johnson, used this technique when he first joined as CEO of Tripwire, Inc., frankly, it blew my mind. He shared his own story, which was so personal and touching it left the rest of us on the executive team emotionally raw, with tears in (almost) everyone’s eyes.

In turn, we all had to share some elements of our own stories, showing vulnerability to each other and enabling the next step, which is to stop fearing conflict. Jim set the tone of the honesty and candor he demanded from everyone, and, trust me, it changed how we behaved and executed, and we started acting more like a team.

This was probably one of the most important lessons in my life. It is now my aspiration in every domain of my life to never fear conflict, never be afraid to tell the truth, and never be afraid to say what I really think. Of course, I’d be delusional to think I can fully achieve this, but I think it’s still a worthy goal.

I’ve been in situations where I’ve observed leadership teams locked in chronic underperformance and strife, because of the utter inability for the team members to trust each other. And when leaders don’t trust each other, then almost certainly, their respective teams won’t trust each other.

From my professional experience, the cost and true consequence of not being able to have candid discussions about problems that everyone knows about, but is unwilling to confront, is incredibly high. Tackling this problem requires overcoming some of our most ingrained and learned behaviors, but the rewards are worth it.

## *Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness and Superior Results*

Another one of the books that deeply influenced us is *Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness and Superior Results *by Shingo Prize winner Mike Rother.[21](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-21) I’ve had the pleasure of meeting him, as well as taking his three-day course, “Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata,” offered through University of Michigan. It includes two days of fieldwork in a real manufacturing plant.

If I could take the liberty of describing Mr. Rother’s journey in my own words, it began over twenty years ago as he was visiting Toyota plants with a team of researchers and American car manufacturing executives. He describes that stage of his journey as capturing and codifying the observed Toyota practices that led to their extraordinary and market-leading performance.

However, when he looks back at that phase of his career, he’ll characterize it as merely teaching people how to mimic the behaviors observed at the Toyota plants, but missing the most important parts of the Toyota culture and values that framed their management practices.

Listening to him talk about this, it’s as if he was calling a significant portion of the Lean Community that he helped train merely a “cargo cult.”[22](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-22)

Mr. Rother’s lessons have been codified in the book *Toyota Kata*, which frames the thought process and culture that must exist to enable the Lean PDCA cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act). I believe that this is one of the most extraordinary contributions to the world of process improvement.

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781457191350/files/image/kata.jpg)

The most obvious manifestation of the Toyota Kata is the two-week improvement cycle, in which every work center supervisor must improve something (anything!) every two weeks. To quote Mr. Rother, “The practice of kata is the act of practicing a pattern so it becomes second nature. In its day-to-day management, Toyota teaches a way of working—a kata—that has helped make it so successful over the last six decades.”

The notion of the need for daily repetition in order to create habits, in order to change the outcomes, is now well established in the domains of sports training, learning to play a musical instrument, military Special Forces training, and now in modern manufacturing. This forms the basis of Erik’s Third Way. He explains, “It’s about how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are the prerequisites to mastery.”

In my mind, Patty’s ITIL/ITSM crusade is very much like the Lean practitioners that Mr. Rother describes who were never able to replicate the performance of Toyota. Why? They’d do a Lean Kaizen event once per year, but then get marginalized from daily operations the remainder of the year.

For us to get the performance gains promised by ITIL/ITSM, Lean, or whatever, we must create a culture of relentless improvement described by Mr. Rother.

Kata impacts your organization by

- providing a systematic, scientific routine that can be applied to any problem or challenge,
- commonizing how the members of an organization develop solutions,
- migrating managers toward a role of coach and mentor, by having them practice coaching cycles, and
- framing PDCA in a way that has people taking small steps every day.

These two-week improvement cycles put constant pressure into the system, forcing it to improve. Mr. Rother asserts that if a system is not improving, the result is not a steady state. Instead, because of entropy, organizational performance declines.

In one of the most startling case studies, Mr. Rother describes observing how a certain work center that was able to decrease the number of workers from six to four. Over the next six weeks, however, the number of workers gradually grew back to six. Entropy.

Patterns like those in the Netflix culture, such as relentless improvement and innovation, ruthless eradication of variance, and injecting faults into the production environment (embodied in tools such as the famous Chaos Monkey), are the perfect embodiment of the Improvement Kata that Mr. Rother describes.

## *Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation*

Erik’s First Way underscores the importance of the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department—this as can be as large a division (e.g., Development or IT Operations) or as small as an individual contributor (e.g., a developer, a system administrator).

In the IT value stream, this is all about the left-to-right flow of work from Development into IT Operations. Probably the best embodiment of this work is Jez Humble and David Farley’s seminal book *Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation*.

They codify many of the techniques required to replicate the famous 2009 Velocity Conference presentation, “10+ Deploys Per Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr,” given by John Allspaw and Paul Hammond, as well as the Agile system administration movement.[23](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-23)

Continuous delivery is the extension of continuous integration, which are the Development practices that include continuous builds, continuous testing, daily integration of branches back into trunk, testing in a clone of the production environment, etc. Continuous delivery techniques extend these processes all the way into the production environment.

(When I read this book, I almost doubled over in agony, realizing how much pain and how many poor decisions I could have averted if I had read this book four years prior. I was associated with an unnamed software company where we had a broken build system for over a year. Without automated builds, you can’t have automated testing, and without automated testing, you’re doomed to painful integration of developer branches, which leads to a downward spiral of less frequent and far more painful integrations, which slows down feature delivery and reduces software quality.)

Imagine my delight when Jez Humble told me that the value stream map exercise that Bill and team went through in chapter 31 of the Development to IT Operations production deployment process was almost precisely what he and Farley did in their book. Awesome.

Continuous delivery is the perfect embodiment of the First, Second, and Third Ways, as it emphasizes small batch sizes (e.g., check into trunk daily), stopping the line when problems occur (e.g., no new work allowed when builds, tests, or deployments fail; elevating the integrity of the system of work over the work itself), and the need to continually build the validation tests necessary to either prevent failures in production, or, at the very least, detect and correct them quickly (e.g., the transition from manual process reviews to automated tests, especially in the ITSM release, change, and configuration process areas).

Continuous deployment is a prerequisite for the high deploy rates characterized by DevOps, and is therefore a needed skill set for the modern DevOps practitioner. It will also be the salvation for a generation of ITSM practitioners. Read it.

## *Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software*

When you watch talks at the Velocity Conference about how organizations like Google, Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, Pinterest, and others are engineering code and environments to operate at scale, you’re often hearing many of the ideas that were first promulgated by Michael T. Nygard in his fantastic book, *Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software*.[24](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-24)

This is a book that helps span the Development and IT Operations divide, by showing developers and architects how to build applications that can be deployed and managed and survive in even the most hostile production environments. When you read this book, you’ll see in his patterns and lessons horror stories from your own past.

IT Operations practitioners need to read this book, too, in order to connect the dots of how specific Development decisions lead to bad production outcomes that they’ve experienced in the past. And more importantly, it will enable them to go to architecture or development meetings with concrete suggestions on how to avoid them in the future.

When Chris and his team deploy Project Unicorn that performs so well in production in *The Phoenix Project*, they obviously read Mr. Nygard’s book.

A little story: I saw Mr. Nygard give an Ignite presentation at the 2010 DevOpsDays in Mountain View, and it was one of the most amazing talks I’ve ever seen. It was one of the most high-fidelity and intense descriptions of a disastrous application deployment that took weeks to recover from, requiring heroics from IT Operations. It still remains my genuine hope that the scenes of the Phoenix deployment failure are as disturbing as my experience watching Mr. Nygard’s presentation.

## Visible Ops and ITIL Service Support

In 1999, when Kevin Behr and I started studying high-performing IT organizations, we found that these were the organizations that were simultaneously achieving the “highest IT service levels (e.g., MTTR, MTBF, change success rates), the earliest integration of information security into the software/service development lifecycle, the best posture of compliance (e.g., fewest number of repeat audit findings), and amazingly, the best IT efficiencies (e.g., server/sysadmin ratios).”[25](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-25)

We had studied eleven high-performing IT organizations that included a bank, a stock exchange, a wireless billing service, a domain name service provider, and two IT service providers.

Kevin and I worked together to understand how these organizations made their “good to great” IT transformations, and codified this transformation in the books *The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps* and *Visible Ops Security: Achieving Common Security and IT Operations Objectives in 4 Practical Steps*, written by the same author team as *The Phoenix Project*.

A critical part of this journey was made possible by the *ITIL Service Support Book* (v2), which no discussion about IT Operations would be complete without. I loved this book when I first read it in 2000, as it catalogued and normalized the key processes that must exist in any high-performing IT organization. But, ITIL remains a descriptive framework, and organizations don’t do descriptive frameworks—they do projects.

Our goal with the Visible Ops series of books was to create a prescriptive, ordered set of steps (projects) to replicate the outcomes we observed in high performers. (Incidentally, this is what we’re attempting to replicate in the upcoming *DevOps Cookbook*).

## Two Great Books on Kanbans

Hopefully by now, I’ve convinced you that the problems associated with too much WIP in IT are truly devastating. Many practitioners believe that kanbans are one of the most effective countermeasures, as well as the simplest.

I have two favorite books on kanbans that I’d recommend to anyone who is even remotely interested in kanbans.

The first book is *Personal Kanban: Mapping Work | Navigating Life* by Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry. This book is more of a personal productivity book than a book about complex value streams. In fact, I’d call this book the modern version of David Allen’s famous book *Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity*.

Where Allen discussed the nature of work, the importance of calendars for keeping commitments, and the theory of filing and contextual TODO lists, Benson and Tonianne discuss the need to visualize all our work and control the amount of WIP. They advocate that everyone should start their own kanban boards with three simple lanes: Ready, Doing, and Done.[26](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-26)

Although I remain a devout David Allen *GTD* fan, after reading *Personal Kanban*, I quickly retired my contextual TODO lists that I’ve been maintaining for nearly a decade in favor of a kanban board. In many ways, I’ve found that it solves one of most challenging aspects of the *GTD* methodology: the weekly executive reviews, where we’re supposed to reprioritize our commitments, prune our TODO lists, etc. There were years in which I never did this supposed weekly activity.

On the other hand, with kanban boards, all my work is visible, and there are WIP limits in place that prevent the number going above a fixed limit. I’ve seen on Jim Benson’s kanban board in his office and his Doing WIP limit is four (i.e., no more than four cards are allowed in the Doing lane).

The second book I’d recommend is David J. Anderson’s book *Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business*; it’s more specific to the use of kanban boards in organizations.

For me, reading this book was unexpectedly delightful, as it further chronicled a Microsoft IT case study that I had chosen to study as part of my EM 526 Constraints Management course. It was a 2005 paper called, “From Worst to Best in 9 Months: Implementing a Drum-Buffer-Rope Solution in Microsoft’s IT Department” by David J. Anderson and Dragos Dumitriu.[27](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-27) Small world, isn’t it?

Both Anderson and Dumitriu were at Microsoft at the time, and they described an abysmal previous state that is likely familiar to most IT practitioners:

- Too long to finish work requested from the business: average lead time was 155 days
- Dissatisfaction with lateness and long lead times forced IT management to do “more work estimation,” forcing managers to spend all their time building PowerPoints (because business conclusion was that they didn’t do a good job estimating), instead of doing real work
- Whenever the business asked for anything, the response was “it’ll take 5 months”
- Every task was estimated at 20 days, but no one knew where the other 135 days went

Dumitriu created a new field in their ticketing system (actually, it was the Microsoft defect tracking system) called “Waiting For Dragos,” to capture when any work was blocked. He quickly concluded that seventy percent of all the team’s time was blocked on other people—in other words, seventy percent of the time the work was in queue.

Dumitriu concluded that his team was only completing three work items per month, and at that rate, it would require three years to complete all that work. Here were the countermeasures that he put into place and the amazing results:

- They stopped estimating their work and instead used actual times based on historical data—they had eighty person-years of work in their ticketing system, so they used that. This resulted in an immediate thirty percent boost to Dev and Test productivity.
- They stopped using cost accounting, using instead a simple “ROI based on budget contribution.” This time-savings resulted in an immediate twenty percent boost to PM capacity.
- Realizing that their constraint was Dev, PM took over many of the Dev tasks, increasing Dev capacity by twenty percent. It also led to happier Developers, because they were coding, instead of doing task estimation.
- They brought in a usability expert to modify the change request forms. (He quipped, “In order to get a glass of water, we had to fill out a 4 page form; we replaced it with a 2 page form, with lots of free-form fields, with the goal of making sure the person doing the work had all the information they needed.”)
- They then reduced the WIP allowed in the system: initially they had, on average, forty to sixty open items. They reduced this down to five.
- They then created a buffer of work, so that any blocked Dev or Test person could work on something in the buffer.
- Their lead time went from 155 days to twenty-two days. Lead times were so good that they created a new SLA guarantee of twenty-five days (Wow!).
- Their next surge in productivity came from increasing the number of developers, because for every two days of Dev work, it required one day of Test work. They promoted testers who wanted to move into Dev, and increased the Dev:Test ratio from 1:1 to 2:1.
- The result of all of this? They completed their entire three years of backlog in nine months; demand for their services went up, and they continued to deliver everything that was asked for each month; no one got fired, and instead people got promoted.

As Dumitriu said, “We succeeded because we focused relentlessly on reducing lead time, as opposed to Dev & Test optimizing for themselves.”

This story is just one of many astounding transformations that are described in brilliant detail. Amazingly, the transformations are not primarily based on automation. Instead, the incredible improvements come from modifying policies around the system of work and the policies that control work in process, ensuring that there are effective cross-functional teams, subordinating everything to the constraint, and managing handoffs well.

Incidentally, Anderson chronicles in his book the changes in his thinking about how to control work in IT value streams. It’s clear that he was a devout follower of Dr. Goldratt’s work (e.g., Theory of Constraints, Drum-Buffer-Rope) but concluded that using kanban boards can achieve most of the benefits through emergent properties.

I highly recommend reading this book, as it chronicles the real-life improvements that he’s made at organizations such as Sprint, Motorola, Microsoft, and Corbis.
