# Introduction

On behalf of my fellow coauthors, thank you so much for reading this book.

*The Phoenix Project* frames how a core, chronic conflict between Development and IT Operations preordains failure for the entire IT organization, as well as the organization it serves. Left unchecked, the conflict increases time to market for Development, creates longer and more problematic deployments during feature releases, increases the number of Sev 1 outages, and IT Operations becomes increasingly buried with unplanned work, making it difficult to retire technical debt.

We now know that it is possible to break this conflict between Development and IT Operations. The proof is that high-performing organizations such as Amazon, Google, Twitter, Etsy, and Netflix are adopting a set of techniques that we now call DevOps, and they are routinely deploying hundreds or even thousands of production changes per day, while preserving world-class reliability, stability, and security. By instituting a set of cultural norms, processes, and practices, these high performers are achieving breathtaking performance.

They are able to quickly deploy changes into production, with a code deployment lead time[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-phoenix-project/9781457191350/48-resourceNotes.xhtml#note-1) measured in minutes or hours, enabling them to innovate and out-experiment their competition in the marketplace, with higher quality and better customer outcomes.
