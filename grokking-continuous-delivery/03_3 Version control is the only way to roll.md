# 3 [](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-3/)[](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-3/)Version control is the only way to roll

### In this chapter

- understanding why version control is essential to CD
- keeping your software in a releasable state by keeping version control green and triggering pipelines based on changes in version control
- defining *config as code*
- enabling automation by storing all configuration in version control

We’re going to start your continuous delivery (CD) journey at the very beginning, with the tool that we need for the basis of absolutely everything we’re going to do next: version control. In this chapter, you’ll learn why version control is crucial to CD and how to use it to set up you and your team for success.

They’re going to break up the backend logic into three services:
