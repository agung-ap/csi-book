# 2 [](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-2/)[](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-2/)A basic pipeline

### In this chapter

- working with the basic building blocks: pipelines
and tasks
- learning the elements of a basic CD pipeline: linting, testing, building, publishing, and deploying
- understanding the role of automation in the execution of pipelines: webhooks, events, and triggering
- exploring the varied terminology in the CD space

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how to create great continuous delivery (CD) pipelines, let’s zoom out and take a look at pipelines as a whole. In this chapter, we’ll look at some pipelines at a high level and identify the basic elements you should expect to see in most CD pipelines.

[](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-2/)To understand[](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-2/)[](/book/grokking-continuous-delivery/chapter-2/) what goes into basic CD pipelines, we’ll take a look at the pipelines used for Cat Picture Website. Cat Picture Website is the best website around for finding and sharing cat pictures! The way it’s built is relatively simple, but since it’s a popular website, the company that runs it (Cat Picture, Inc.) has architected it into
several services.

##### What’s CD again?

We use *CD* in this book to refer to *continuous delivery*. See chapter 1 for more.

The company runs Cat Picture Website in the cloud (its cloud provider is called Big Cloud, Inc.) and it uses some of Big Cloud’s services, such as Big Cloud Blob Storage service.

##### What’s a pipeline?

Don’t worry, we’ll get into that in a couple of pages!
